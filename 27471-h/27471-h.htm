<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A MODERN RICHELIEU</h3>
</div>

<p>The Howe and Webster farms adjoined,
lying on a sun-flooded, gently sloping New
Hampshire hillside. Between them loomed
The Wall. It was not a high wall. On the
contrary, its formidableness was the result of
tradition rather than of fact. For more than
a century it had been an estranging barrier to
neighborliness, to courtesy, to broad-mindedness;
a barrier to friendship, to Christian
charity, to peace.</p>
<p>The builder of the rambling line of gray
stone had long since passed away, and had he
not acquired a warped importance with the
years, his memory would doubtless have perished
with him. All unwittingly, alas, he had
become a celebrity. His was the fame of
omission, however, rather than of commission.
Had he, like artist or sculptor, but affixed his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
signature to his handiwork, then might he have
sunk serenely into oblivion, &#8220;unwept, unhonored,
and unsung.&#8221; But unfortunately he was
a modest creature. Instead, he had stepped
nameless into the silence of the Hereafter,
leaving to those who came after him not only
the sinister boundary his hands had reared, but
also a feud that had seethed hotly for generations.</p>
<p>If within the narrow confines of his last resting
place he had ever been conscious of the
dissension for which he was responsible and
had been haunted by a desire to utter the magic
word he had neglected to speak in life, he at
least gave no sign. His lips remained sealed
in death, and his spirit was never seen to walk
abroad. Possibly he retired into his shroud
with this finality because he never found it imperative,
as did Hamlet&#8217;s ghost, to admonish
posterity to remember him.</p>
<p>Only too well was he remembered!</p>
<p>The Howes and Websters who followed him
hurled against the sounding board of heaven
the repeated questions of who built the wall,
and whose duty was it to repair it. Great-grandfather
Jabez Howe quibbled with Great-grandfather
Abiatha Webster for a lifetime,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
and both went down into the tomb still quibbling
over the enigma. Afterward Grandfather
Nathan Howe and Grandfather Ebenezer
Webster took up the dispute, and they,
too, were gathered into the Beyond without
ever reaching a conclusion. Their children
then wrangled and argued and slandered one
another, and, like their forbears, retired from
the field in impotent rage, leaving the combat
a draw.</p>
<p>In the meantime the outlines of the ancient
landmark became less clear-cut. Rocks toppled
from its summit; yawning gaps marred its
sharp edges; and at its base vines and growing
things began to creep defiantly in and out the
widening fissures that rent its foundation.
Almost imperceptibly year by year dissolution
went on, the crude structure melting into picturesqueness
and taking on the gentle charm of
a ruin until Martin Howe and Ellen Webster,
its present-day guardians, beheld it an ignominious
heap of stone that lay crumbling amid
woodbine and clematis.</p>
<p>Far more beautiful was it in this half-concealed
dilapidation than ever it had been in the
pride of its perfection. Then it had stood
boldly out against the landscape, naked and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
aggressive; to-day, clothed in Nature&#8217;s soft
greenery, it had become so dim a heritage that
it might easily have receded into the past and
been forgotten had not the discord of which it
had become the symbol been wilfully fanned
into flame.</p>
<p>As in a bygone age one runner passed a
lighted torch on to another, so did one generation
of Howes and Websters bequeath to the
next the embers of a wrath that never died.
Each faction disclaimed all responsibility for
the wall, and each refused to lay hand to
it.</p>
<p>Adamantine as was the lichen-covered heap
of granite, it was of far more mutable a quality
than were the dispositions of those who had
so stubbornly let it fall into decay. Time&#8217;s
hand had softened the harsh stone into mellow
beauty; but the flintlike characters of the
Howes and Websters remained uncompromising
as of yore.</p>
<p>And now that Martin Howe and Ellen
Webster reigned in their respective homesteads,
neither one of them was any more graciously
inclined toward raising the fallen
boundary to its pristine glory than had been
their progenitors. But for their obstinacy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
they might have agreed to dispense with the
wall altogether, since long ago it had become
merely an empty emblem of restriction, and
without recourse to it each knew beyond question
where the dividing line between the estates
ran; moreover, as both families shunned the
other&#8217;s land as if it were plague-ridden territory
there was scant temptation for them to
invade each other&#8217;s domains. But the man
and the woman had inherited too much of the
blood of the original stock to consider entering
into an armistice.</p>
<p>They had, it is true, bettered their predecessors
to the extent of exchanging a stilted
greeting when they met; but this perfunctory
salutation was usually hurtled across the historic
borderline and was seldom concluded
without some reference to it. For Ellen Webster
was an aggravating old woman dowered
with just enough of the harpy never to be able
to leave her antagonist in peace if she saw him
at work in his garden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mornin&#8217;, Martin,&#8221; she would call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good mornin&#8217;, Miss Webster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re plowin&#8217; up a new strip of land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, marm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose you know it would save you a deal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
of cartin&#8217; if you was to use the stones you&#8217;re
gettin&#8217; out to fix up your wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the hector would watch the brick-red
color steal slowly from the man&#8217;s cheek up to
his forehead.</p>
<p>To pile the stones on the heap so near at
hand would, he recognized, have saved both
time and trouble; nevertheless, he would have
worked until he dropped in his tracks rather
than have yielded to the temptation.</p>
<p><i>His</i> wall, indeed! The impudence of the
vixen!</p>
<p>Angry in every fiber of his body, he would
therefore wheel upon his tormentor and flash
out:</p>
<p>&#8220;When you see me tinkerin&#8217; your tumbledown
wall, Miss Ellen Webster, I&#8217;ll be some
older than I am now. I&#8217;ve work enough of my
own to do without takin&#8217; in repairs for my
neighbors.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that he would hear a malicious chuckle.</p>
<p>For some such response Ellen always waited.
She liked to see the fire of rage burn itself
through Martin&#8217;s tan and feel that she had the
power to kindle it. He never disappointed
her. Sometimes, to be sure, she had to prod
him more than once, but eventually his retort,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
sharp as the sting of an insect, was certain to
come. From it she derived a half-humorous,
half-vindictive satisfaction, for she was a keen
student of human nature, and no one knew
better than she that after the cutting words had
left his lips proud-spirited young Martin
scorned himself for having been goaded into
uttering them.</p>
<p>A tantalizing creature, Ellen Webster!</p>
<p>Silent, penurious, shrewd to the margin of
dishonesty; unrelenting as the rock-fronted
fastnesses of her native hills; good-humored at
times and even possessed of swift moods of
tenderness that disarmed and appealed&mdash;such
she was. She stood straight as a spruce despite
the burden of her years, and a suggestion of
girlhood&#8217;s bloom still colored her cheek; but the
features of her crafty countenance were tightly
drawn; the blue eyes glinted with metallic
light; and the mouth was saved from cruelty
only by its upward curve of humor.</p>
<p>She had been an only daughter who since her
teens had nursed invalid parents until death
had claimed them and left her mistress of the
homestead where she now lived. There had, it
is true, been a boy; but in his early youth he
had shaken the New Hampshire dust from off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
his feet and gone West, from which Utopia he
had for a time sent home to his sister occasional
and peculiarly inappropriate gifts of Mexican
saddles, sombreros, leggings, and Indian blankets.
He had received but scant gratitude,
however, for these well-intentioned offerings.
It had always been against the traditions of the
Websters to spend money freely and Ellen, a
Webster to the core, resented his lack of prudence;
furthermore the articles were useless
and cluttered up the house. Possibly the more
open-handed Thomas understood the implied
rebuke in the meager thanks awarded him and
was hurt by it; at any rate, he ceased sending
home presents, and by and by Ellen lost trace
of him altogether. Years of silence, unbroken
by tidings of any sort, followed. Ellen
had almost forgotten she had a brother when
one day a letter arrived announcing his
death.</p>
<p>The event brought to the sister no grief, for
years ago Thomas had passed out of her life.
Nevertheless the message left behind it an
aftermath of grim realizations that stirred her
to contemplate the future from quite a new
angle. She had never before considered herself
old. Now she suddenly paused and reflected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
upon her seventy-five years and the uncertainty
of the stretch of days before her.</p>
<p>Through the window she could see her prosperous
lands, her garden upon the southern
slope of the hill where warm sun kissed into life
its lushly growing things; her pasture pierced
by jagged rocks, and cattle-trampled stretches
of rough turf; her wood lot where straight
young pines and oak saplings lifted their reaching
crests toward the sky; her orchard, the index
of her progenitor&#8217;s foresight. All these
had belonged to the Websters for six generations,
and she could not picture them the property
of any one bearing another name; nor
could she endure the thought of the wall being
sometime rebuilt by an outsider.</p>
<p>What was to be the fate of her possessions
after she was gone? Suppose a stranger purchased
the estate. Or, worse than all, suppose
that after she was dead Martin Howe was to
buy it in. The Howes had always wanted
more land.</p>
<p>Imagine Martin Howe plowing up the rich
loam of her fields, invading with his axe the
dim silences of her wood lot, enjoying the fruit
of her orchard, driving his herds into her pasture!
Fancy his feet grating upon the threshold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
of her home, his tread vibrating on her
stairways! The irony of it!</p>
<p>Martin was young. At least, he was not
old. He could not be more than forty. He
might marry sometime. Many a man more
unapproachable even than Martin Howe did
marry.</p>
<p>And if he should marry, what would be more
likely than that he would give to his maiden
sisters&mdash;Mary, Eliza, and Jane&mdash;the Howe
farm and take for his own abode the more spacious
homestead of the Websters?</p>
<p>Ellen&#8217;s brows contracted fiercely; then her
mouth twisted into a crooked smile.</p>
<p>What a retribution if, after all, it should be
Martin whose fate it was to rebuild the wall!
Why, such a revenge would almost compensate
for the property falling into his hands! Suppose
it should become his lot to cut away the
vines and underbrush; haul hither the great
stones and hoist them into place! And if while
he toiled at the hateful task and beads of sweat
rolled from his forehead, a sympathetic and indulgent
Providence would but permit her to
come back to earth and, standing at his elbow,
jeer at him while he did it! Ah, that would be
revenge indeed!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>Then the mocking light suddenly died from
the old woman&#8217;s eyes. Maybe Martin would
not buy the farm, after all.</p>
<p>Or if he did, he might perhaps leave the wall
to crumble into extinction, so that the rancor
and bitterness of the Howes and Websters
would come to an end, and the enmity of a hundred
years be wasted!</p>
<p>Would not such an inglorious termination of
the feud go down to history as a capitulation
of the Websters? Why, the broil had become
famous throughout the State. For decades it
had been a topic of gossip and speculation until
the Howe and Webster obstinacy had become
a byword, almost an adage. To have the whole
matter peter out now would be ignominious.</p>
<p>No. Though worms destroyed her mortal
body, the hostility bred between the families
should not cease. Nor should her ancestral
home ever become the prey of her enemies,
either.</p>
<p>Rising decisively, Ellen took from the mahogany
secretary the letter she had received a
few days before from Thomas&#8217;s daughter and
reread it meditatively.</p>
<p>Twice she scanned its pages. Then she let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
it drop into her lap. Again her eyes wandered
to the stretch of land outside across which
slanted the afternoon shadows.</p>
<p>The day was very still. Up from the tangle
of brakes in the pasture came the lowing of cattle.
A faint sweetness from budding apple
trees filled the room. Radiating, narrowing
away toward the sky line, row after row of low
green shoots barred the brown earth of the hillside
with the promise of coming harvest. It
was a goodly sight,&mdash;that plowed land with its
lines of upspringing seeds. A goodly sight,
too, were the broad mowings stirring gently
with the sweep of the western breeze.</p>
<p>Ellen regarded the panorama before her
musingly. Then she seated herself at the old
desk and with deliberation began to write a
reply to her brother&#8217;s child.</p>
<p>She was old, she wrote, and her health was
failing; at any time she might find herself helpless
and ill. There was no one to care for her
or bear her company. If Lucy would come to
Sefton Falls and live, her aunt would be glad
to give her a home.</p>
<p>&#8220;As yet,&#8221; concluded the diplomat, with a
Machiavelian stroke of the pen, &#8220;I have made
no will; but I suppose I shall not be able to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
take the Webster lands and money with me
into the next world. You are my only relative.
Think well before making your decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>After she had signed and blotted the terse
missive, Ellen perused its lines, and her sharp
eyes twinkled. It was a good letter, a capital
letter! Without actually promising anything,
it was heavy with insidious bribery.</p>
<p>Be the girl of whatsoever type she might,
some facet of the note could not fail to lure her
hither. If a loyal Webster, family obligation
would be the bait; if conscientious, plain duty
stared her in the face; if mercenary, dreams of
an inherited fortune would tempt her. The
trap was inescapable.</p>
<p>In the meantime to grant a home to her
orphan flesh and blood would appeal to the
outside world as an act of Christian charity,
and at the same time would save hiring the help
she had for some time feared she would be
driven to secure,&mdash;a fact that did not escape
the woman&#8217;s cunning mind.</p>
<p>She was not so strong as formerly, and of
late the toil of the farm taxed her endurance.
There was milking, sewing, the housework, and
the care of the chickens; enough to keep ten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
pairs of hands busy, let alone one. Oh, Lucy
should earn her board, never fear!</p>
<p>As nearly as the aunt could calculate, her
niece must now be about twenty years old,&mdash;a
fine, vigorous age! Doubtless, too, the girl
was of buxom Western build, for although
Thomas had not married until late in life, his
wife had been a youthful woman of the mining
country. This Lucy was probably a strapping
lass, who in exchange for her three meals would
turn off a generous day&#8217;s work. Viewed from
every standpoint the scheme was an inspiration.</p>
<p>Ellen hoped it would not fail. Now that
she had made up her mind to carry through the
plan, she could not brook the possibility of being
thwarted.</p>
<p>Once more she took the letter from its envelope
and read it. Yes, it was excellent.
Were she to write it all over again she could
not improve it. Therefore she affixed the
stamp and address and, summoning Tony, the
Portuguese lad who slaved for her, she sent
him to the village to mail it.</p>
<p>For two weeks she awaited an answer, visiting
the post office each day with a greater degree
of interest than she had exhibited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
toward any outside event for a long stretch of
years.</p>
<p>Her contact with the world was slight and
infrequent. Now and then she was obliged to
harness up and drive to the village for provisions;
to have the horse shod; or to sell her
garden truck; but she never went unless forced
to do so. A hermit by nature, she had no
friends and wanted none.</p>
<p>Her only neighbors were the Howes, and
beyond the impish pleasure she derived from
taunting Martin, they had no interest for her.
The sisters were timid, inoffensive beings
enough; but had they been three times as inoffensive
they were nevertheless Howes; moreover,
Ellen did not care for docile people. She
was a fighter herself and loved a fighter. That
was the reason she had always cherished a covert
admiration for Martin. His temper appealed
to her; so did his fearlessness and his
mulish attitude toward the wall. Such qualities
she understood. But with these cringing
sisters of his who allowed him to tyrannize over
them she had nothing in common. Had she
not seen them times without number watch him
out of sight and then leap to air his blankets,
beat his coat, or perform some service they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
dared not enact in his presence? Bah! Thank
Heaven she was afraid of nobody and was independent
of her fellow men.</p>
<p>Save for the assistance of the hard-worked
Tony whom she paid&mdash;paid sparingly she confessed,
but nevertheless <i>paid</i>&mdash;she attended to
her own plowing, planting, and harvesting, and
was beholden to nobody. The world was her
natural enemy. To outwit it; to beat it at a
bargain; to conquer where it sought to oppress
her; to keep its whining dogs of pain, poverty,
and loneliness ever at bay; to live without obligation
to it; and die undaunted at leaving it,&mdash;this
was her ambition.</p>
<p>The note she had mailed to her niece was the
first advance she had made toward any human
being within her memory; and this was not the
cry of a dependent but rather the first link in a
plot to outgeneral circumstances and place the
future within her own control. She prided
herself that for half a century she had invariably
got the better of whosoever and whatsoever
she had come in contact with. What was
death, then, but an incident, if after it she
might still reign and project her will into the
universe even from the estranging fastnesses
of the grave?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>Therefore the answer from Lucy was of
greater import than was any ordinary letter.
It would tell her whether the initial step in her
conspiracy to triumph over Destiny was successful.
What wonder that her aged fingers
trembled as she tore open the envelope of the
message and spread the snowy paper feverishly
on the table?</p>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Aunt Ellen:</span></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t tell you what a surprise it was
to hear from you, and how much greater a surprise
it was to have you ask me to come and
live with you.</p>
<p>I had decided to go abroad and do Red Cross
work, and was about to accept a position that
had been offered me when your letter arrived.
(&#8220;Humph!&#8221; murmured Ellen.)</p>
<p>But you write that you are alone in the world
and not very well, and this being the case, I
feel my place is with you.</p>
<p>You are my only relative, and I should be a
very poor-spirited Webster indeed did I not
acknowledge that your claim comes before any
other. Therefore I shall be glad to come to
New Hampshire and avail myself of your hospitality.
I presume you have found, as I have,
that living entirely for one&#8217;s self is not very
satisfactory after all. Since my father&#8217;s death
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
I have had no one to look after and have felt
lonely, useless, and selfish in consequence.</p>
<p>I am certain that in attempting to make you
happy, I shall find happiness myself, and I
assure you that I will do all I can to be helpful.</p>
<p>If all goes well I should arrive at Sefton
Falls in about ten days. In the meantime, I
send my warmest thanks for your kindness and
the affectionate greetings of</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='margin-right:6em;'>Your niece,</p>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lucy Harmon Webster.</span></p>
</div>

</div>
<p>After she had finished reading the letter,
Ellen sat tapping her foot impatiently upon
the floor. She was nettled, angry.</p>
<p>She did not at all relish having this child
turn the tables on her charity and make of it a
favor. As for the girl&#8217;s sentimental nonsense
about its not being satisfactory to live alone,
what was she talking about? Living alone was
the most satisfactory thing in the world. Did
it not banish all the friction of opposing wills
and make of one a monarch? No, she did not
like the letter, did not like it.</p>
<p>If this Lucy were sincere, she showed herself
to be of that affectionate, conscientious,
emotional type Ellen so cordially detested;
besides, she held her head too high. If on the
other hand, she were shamming, and were in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
reality endowed with a measure of the Howe
shrewdness, that was another matter.</p>
<p>Her aunt laughed indulgently at the girl&#8217;s
youthful attempt at subterfuge. She hoped
she was humbugging. Worldly wisdom was
an admirable trait. Had not the Websters
always been famed for their business sagacity?
She would far rather find Thomas&#8217;s daughter
blessed with a head than with a heart.</p>
<p>But the letter proved that the child was still
a novice at the wiles of the world, dissemble as
she would.</p>
<p>Had she been older and more discerning, she
would have realized she had not actually been
promised anything, and she would not have
been decoyed into journeying hundreds of
miles from home to pursue the wraith of an
ephemeral fortune.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE HOWES</h3>
</div>

<p>Within the confines of his own home
Martin Howe, as Ellen Webster asserted, was
a czar. Born with the genius to rule, he would
probably have fought his way to supremacy
had struggle been necessary. As it was, however,
no effort was demanded of him, for by
the common consent of an adoring family, he
had been voluntarily elevated to throne and
scepter. He was the only boy, the coveted
gift long denied parents blessed with three
daughters and in despair of ever possessing a
son.</p>
<p>What rejoicings heralded his advent! Had
half the treasures an eager father and mother
prayed Heaven to grant been bestowed upon
the child, he would unquestionably have become
an abnormality of health, wealth, and
wisdom. But Destiny was too farseeing a
goddess to allow her neophyte to be spoiled by
prosperity. Both his parents died while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
Martin was still a pupil at the district school, and
the lad, instead of going to the city and pursuing
a profession, as had been his ambition,
found himself hurried, all unequipped, uneducated
and unprepared, into the responsibilities
of managing the family household.</p>
<p>Farming was not the calling he would have
chosen. He neither liked it, nor was he endowed
with that intuitive sixth sense on which
so many farmers rely for guidance amid the
mazes of plowing and planting. By nature,
he was a student. The help he had sporadically
given his father had always been given rebelliously
and been accompanied by the mental
resolve that the first moment escape was possible,
he would leave the country and its nagging
round of drudgery and take up a broader
and more satisfying career.</p>
<p>To quote Martin&#8217;s own vernacular, farming
was hard work,&mdash;<i>damned hard work.</i> It was
not, however, the amount of toil it involved that
daunted him, but its quality. He had always
felt a hearty and only thinly veiled contempt
for manual labor; moreover, he considered life
in a small village an extremely provincial one.</p>
<p>It was just when he was balancing in his
mind the relative advantages of becoming a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
doctor or a lawyer, and speculating as to which
of these professions appealed the more keenly
to his fancy, that Fate intervened and relieved
him of the onerousness of choosing between
them.</p>
<p>Martin could have viewed almost any other
vocation than that of farmer through a mist
of romance, for he was young, and for him, behind
the tantalizingly veiled future, there still
moved the shadowy forms of knights, dragons,
and fair ladies; but with the grim eye of a realist,
he saw farming as it was, stripped of every
shred of poetry. Blossoming orchards and
thriving crops he knew to be the ephemeral
phantasms of the dreamer. Farming as he had
experienced it was an eternal combat against
adverse conditions; a battle against pests,
frosts, soil, weather, and weariness. The conflict
never ceased, nor was there hope of emerging
from its sordidness into the high places
where were breathing space and vision. One
could never hope when night came to glance
back over the day and see in retrospect a finished
piece of work. There was no such thing
as writing <i>finis</i> beneath any chapter of the ponderous
tome of muscle-racking labor.</p>
<p>The farmer stopped work at twilight only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
because his strength was spent and daylight
was gone. The aching back, the tired muscles,
could do no more, and merciful darkness drew
a curtain over the day, thereby cutting off
further opportunity for toil until the rising of
another sun.</p>
<p>But although night carried with it temporary
relief from exertion, it brought with it
little peace. As one sat at the fireside in the
gathering dusk, it was only to see in imagination
a sinister procession of specters file past.
They were the things that had been left undone.
On they swept, one unperformed task
treading upon the heel of its predecessor.
There still remained potatoes to spade, weeds
to pull, corn to hoe. A menacing company of
ghosts to harass a weary man as his eyes closed
at night and confront him when he opened
them in the morning!</p>
<p>And even when, with the zest the new day
brought, he contrived to mow down the vanguard
of the parade, other recruits were constantly
reënforcing its rear ranks and swelling
the foes arraigned against the baffled farmer.
Struggle as he would, the line was sometimes
longer at evening than it had been at dawn.
What wonder that a conscientious fellow like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
Martin Howe felt farming less a business to
be accomplished than a choice of alternatives?
What rest was there in sleep, if all the time
one&#8217;s eyes were closed a man was subconsciously
aware that cutworms were devouring
his lettuce and that weeds were every instant
gaining headway? Even the rhythm of the
rain was a reminder that the pea vines were
being battered down and that the barn roof
was leaking.</p>
<p>Yet to flee from this uncongenial future and
seek one more to his liking did not occur to
Martin Howe. He had been born with an uncompromising
sense of duty, and once convinced
of an obligation, he would have scorned
to shirk it. The death of his parents left him
no choice but to take up his cross with New
England Spartanism and bear it like a true
disciple. All the Howe capital was invested
in land, in stock, and in agricultural implements.
To sell out, even were he so fortunate
as to find a purchaser, would mean shrinkage.
And the farm once disposed of, what then?
Had he been alone in the world, he would not
have paused to ask the question. But there
were Mary, Eliza, and Jane,&mdash;three sisters
older than himself with no resources for earning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
a living. Even he himself was unskilled,
and should he migrate to the city, he would be
forced to subsist more or less by his wits; and
to add to his uncertain fortunes the burden of
three dependent women would be madness.
No, the management of the family homestead
was his inevitable lot. That he recognized.</p>
<p>What the abandonment of his &#8220;Castles in
Spain&#8221; cost Martin only those who knew him
best appreciated; and they but dimly surmised.
Resolutely he kept his face set before him, allowing
himself no backward glances into the
<i>dolce-far-niente</i> land left behind. As it was
characteristic of him to approach any problem
from the scholar&#8217;s standpoint, he attacked his
agricultural puzzles from a far more scientific
angle than his father had done, bringing to
them an intelligence that often compensated
for experience and opened before him vistas of
surprising interest. He subscribed to garden
magazines; studied into crop rotation and the
grafting of trees and vines; spent a few months
at college experimenting with soils and chemicals.
He investigated in up-to-date farming
machinery and bought some of the devices he
felt would economize labor.</p>
<p>Gradually the problem of wresting a living
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
from the soil broadened and deepened until it
assumed alluring proportions. Farming became
a conundrum worthy of the best brain,
and one at which the supercilious could ill afford
to scoff. Martin found himself giving to
it the full strength both of his body and mind.</p>
<p>By the end of the first year he had become
resigned to his new career; by the end of the
second interested in it; by the end of the third
enthusiastic.</p>
<p>In the meantime, as season succeeded season,
the soil he had so patiently tended began to
give him thanks, returning ever increasing
harvests. The trees in the old orchard bent
under their weight of apples; the grapevines
were lush with fruit. The Howe farm acquired
fame in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>The boy was proud of his success and justly
so. Not alone did it represent man&#8217;s triumph
over Nature, but it also meant the mastery of
Martin&#8217;s own will over his inclinations. And
all the while that he was achieving this dual
victory he was developing from a thin, over-grown
lad into a muscular young giant,&mdash;keen-eyed,
broad-shouldered, deep-chested, strong-armed.
He was lithe as an Indian and almost
as unwearying. If through the cross rifts of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
his daily routine there filtered occasional
shadows of loneliness, he only vaguely acknowledged
their existence, attributing his groping
longing for sympathy to the lack of male companionship
and the uncongeniality that existed
between himself and his sisters.</p>
<p>He had, to be sure, a few masculine acquaintances
in the village, but most of them were
older and less progressive than he, and they
offered him little aid in his difficulties. Having
farmed all their lives and been content with
the meager results they had obtained, they
shrugged their shoulders at Martin&#8217;s experiments
with irrigation and fertilizer, regarding
his attempts as the impractical theories of a
fanatic. Of youth, Sefton Falls contained
only a scattering, the more enterprising young
men having gone either to the city or to the
War.</p>
<p>Thus bereft of friends of his own sex, and
turned back from a professional or a soldier&#8217;s
career by Duty&#8217;s flaming sword, Martin reverted
to his own home for comradeship. But
here, alas, he was again disappointed.</p>
<p>Mary, Eliza, and Jane were not of a type
to fill the void in his life that he sought to have
filled. It would be unfair to say he had not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
a warm regard for his sisters, for he was a
person of inherent loyalty, and ties of blood
meant much to him. Had he not sacrificed
his own dreams that his family might retain
their old home? Nevertheless one may have a
deep-rooted affection for one&#8217;s kin and yet not
find them congenial; and Martin was compelled
to acknowledge that Mary, Eliza and
Jane&mdash;estimable women as they were&mdash;had
many fundamental characteristics that were
quite out of harmony with his ideals of life.
It was possible their faults were peculiar to the
entire feminine race. He was not prepared to
say, since his knowledge of the sex had never
extended beyond the sill of his own doorway.
But whether general or particular, the truth
remained that the mental horizon of his sisters,
bounded as it was by the four walls of the
kitchen and such portion of the outside world
as could be seen from its windows, was pitiably
narrow.</p>
<p>Beyond the round of their daily duties none
of the three women had an interest in life.
Over and over again they performed their
humdrum tasks in the same humdrum fashion,
arguing over each petty detail of the time-worn
theme until he marveled they could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
retain a particle of zest for routine they never
varied from year to year.</p>
<p>Reading and experimenting brought a freshness
to his work that stimulated detours into
untraveled paths. But Mary, Eliza, and Jane
never sought out the uncharted way. Evidently
monotony suited their stolid temperaments;
or if it did not, they never rebelled
against it or tried to shake off its fetters.
Matter-of-fact, timid, faithful, capable, middle-aged,&mdash;they
were born to be plodders rather
than explorers.</p>
<p>Martin admitted that to their undeviating
system he owed a great measure of the comfort
and tranquillity of his well-ordered house, and
hence he struggled earnestly not to complain
at the bondage that resulted from their cast-iron
methods. Long since he had despaired of
expecting adaptability from them. They
must cling to their rut or all was <i>lost.</i> Once
out of their customary channel, and they were
like tossing ships, rudderless and without an
anchor.</p>
<p>Their solicitude for him was another source
of exasperation. There were days when the
brute in him rose and clamored to strike Mary
for tagging at his heels with coats and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
medicines, and Eliza for her lynxlike observation of
every mouthful he ate. But he curbed the impulse,
shamefacedly confessing himself to be
ungrateful.</p>
<p>Had his tolerance been reënforced by insight,
he would have understood that the very
qualities which so exasperated him sprang
from his sister&#8217;s laudable desire to voice a gratitude
they could not put into words by neglecting
no act which would promote his welfare;
but Martin, alas, was not a psychologist, and
therefore was unable to translate his annoyances
in these interpretative terms.</p>
<p>In truth, what Mary, Eliza, and Jane were
as individuals concerned him very little. He
always thought of them as a composite personality,
a sort of female trinity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Mary, Eliza, and Jane Howe
were not a trinity. They were three very distinct
beings.</p>
<p>Mary had had spinsterhood thrust upon her.
At heart she was a mother, a woman created to
nurse and comfort. Her greatest happiness
was derived from fluttering about those she
loved and waiting upon them. Had she dared,
she would have babied Martin to an even
greater extent than she did. As it was, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
she was not at his elbow with warmer socks,
heavier shoes, or a cup of hot coffee, she was
worrying about Mary and Eliza, brewing
tonics for them, or putting burning soapstones
in their beds. It was a pity Life had cheated
her of having a dozen babies to pilot through
the mazes of measles and whooping cough, for
then Mary would have been in her element.
Yet nature is a thing of inconsistencies, and
through some strange, unaccountable caprice,
Mary&#8217;s marital instincts stopped with this
fostering instinct. In every other respect she
was an old maid. Men she abhorred. Like
Jennie Wren, she knew their tricks and their
manners&mdash;or thought she did&mdash;which for all
practical purposes amounted to the same thing.
Had it been necessary for her to prove some of
the theorems she advanced concerning the male
sex, she would have been at a loss to do so,
since the scope of her experience was very
limited. Nevertheless, with genuine Howe
tenacity, she clung to her tenets even though
she was without data to back them up.</p>
<p>Eliza, on the other hand, had in her girlhood
been the recipient of certain vague attentions
from an up-State farmer, and these had bared
to her virgin imagination a new world. True,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
the inconstant swain had betaken himself to the
next county and there wed another. But although
the affair had come to this ignominious
end and its radiance had been dimmed by the
realities of a quarter of a century of prosaic
life, Eliza had never allowed time to obscure
entirely the beauty of that early dream, nor
the door thus opened into the fairy realms of
romance to be wholly closed. Though she
knew herself to be old, silver-haired, and worn,
yet within the fastnesses of her soul she was
still young and waited the coming of her lover.
The illusion was only an illusion&mdash;a foolish,
empty fantasy. However, it helped her to be
content with the present and harmed no one.
That Eliza had never quite &#8220;quit struggling&#8221;
was borne out by the ripples into which she
coaxed her hair and by the knot of bright
ribbon she never failed to fasten beneath her
ample chin.</p>
<p>Of the trio, Jane was the best balanced.
Although the youngest of the sisters, it was to
her judgment they were wont to appeal in
times of stress. She was more fearless, more
outspoken; and any mission she undertook was
more certain of success. Therefore, when it
became necessary to present some cause to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
Martin, it always fell to Jane&#8217;s lot to act as
spokesman. Once when a controversy concerning
Ellen Webster had arisen, Jane had
actually had the temerity to denounce her
brother&#8217;s attitude to his face, declaring that
should the old woman fall ill she would certainly
go and take care of her. Martin had
met her defiance with rage. The Websters
and all their kindred might die before he would
cross their threshold or allow any of his family
to do so. Before the violence of his wrath,
Mary and Eliza, who within their souls agreed
with Jane, quailed in terror; but Jane was undaunted.</p>
<p>This lack of what Martin termed <i>proper
pride</i> in his sisters was a source of great disgust
to him. He was quite conscious that although
they did not openly combat his opinions,
they did not agree with him, and not only
regretted being at odds with their neighbors
but also condemned his perpetuation of the old
feud as unchristian. Hence it was a cause for
much rejoicing to his mind to reflect that one
male Howe at least survived to bolster up a
spineless, spiritless, and decadent generation.
To love one&#8217;s enemies was a weak creed. Martin
neither loved them nor pretended to.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
Never, never, would he forgive the insults the
Websters had heaped upon his family. He
wished no positive harm to Ellen Webster; but
he certainly wished her no good.</p>
<p>Mary, Eliza, and Jane had too much timidity
and too great a craving for peace not to conform
outwardly at least to their brother&#8217;s
wishes. Accordingly they bent their necks
to his will; for did not Martin rule the
house?</p>
<p>Had you inquired of any of the sisters the
Howes&#8217; breakfast hour, you would have been
told that breakfast was served when Martin
pleased. It was the sound of his step upon the
stair that set preparations for the morning
meal in motion. So it was with every other
detail of the home. When he appeared in the
doorway his handmaidens sprang to serve him,
and so long as he lingered beneath the roof
they stayed their impatient hands from any
task that would create noise or confusion, and
disturb his tranquillity. It was not until the
ban of his presence was removed that they
ventured to resume the mopping, dusting, or
cooking in which they had been engaged before
his entrance.</p>
<p>It would have been interesting to know how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
Martin explained to himself the lack of machinery
in his household, and how he reconciled the
spotlessness of his home with the apparent idleness
of his sisters. His hearth was always
swept; the dishes noiselessly washed; the beds
made as if by magic; and the cleaning done
without shadow of inconvenience to him. So
long as these processes were not forced upon
his consciousness and were faultlessly performed,
he accepted the results without comment.
But let one cog of the wheel slip,
setting the mechanism of his comfort awry, and
he was sure to mention it.</p>
<p>Possibly it was because he himself performed
his out-of-door duties well that he demanded,
and felt he had the right to demand a similar
perfection within doors. In fact, he drew the
lines of demarkation between the masculine and
feminine spheres of service so sharply that his
sisters would have died before they would have
asked his aid in any domestic difficulty. Faithfully
he met every obligation he considered to
be within a man&#8217;s province,&mdash;bringing wood,
coal, and kindlings with the courtesy of a
courtier; but the fowl browning in the oven
might have burned to ebony before Martin
would have lifted a finger to rescue it. To
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
oversee the cooking was not his duty. No
autocrat ever reigned with more absolute
power than did Martin Howe; and no monarch
ever maintained a more sincere faith in his
divine right to rule. He simply set the crown
of sovereignty upon his own brows because he
believed it to belong there. And had his faith
in his destiny wavered, there were always his
slaves Mary, Eliza, and Jane to bow their foreheads
in the dust at his feet and murmur with
true Oriental submissiveness:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Oh, King, Live Forever!</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>His lordship being thus acknowledged, was it
any wonder that Martin cast about himself a
mantle of aloofness and dignity and rated as
trivial the household routine and petty gossip
of his sisters? When he listened to their
chatter at all it was with the tolerance of a
superior being toward a less intelligent rabble.</p>
<p>Hence when he returned from the field one
night and was greeted by the breathless announcement
that a strange young woman with
her trunk had just arrived at the Websters&#8217;, it
was characteristic of him to quiet the excited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
outburst of his sisters with the chilling and
stately reply:</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it matter to us who she is, or
what she&#8217;s come for? Ellen Webster&#8217;s visitors
are no concern of ours.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>LUCY</h3>
</div>

<p>In the meantime the being whom Martin had
dismissed with this majestic wave of his hand
stood in the middle of the Webster kitchen,
confronting the critical eyes of its mistress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Aunt Ellen,&#8221; the girl was saying,
catching the elder woman&#8217;s stiff fingers in hers,
&#8220;I&#8217;m Lucy. Do you think I look like Dad?
And am I at all what you expected?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen drew her hands uncomfortably from
the impulsive grasp but did not reply immediately.
She was far too bewildered to do so.</p>
<p>Lucy was not in the least what she had expected,&mdash;that
was certain. In the delicate oval
face there was no trace of Thomas&#8217;s heavily
modeled features; nor was Lucy indebted to
the Websters for her aureole of golden hair,
the purity of her blond skin, or her grave
brown eyes. Thomas had been a massively
formed, kindly, plain-featured man; but his
daughter was beautiful. Even Ellen, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
habitually scoffed at all that was fair and banished
the æsthetic world as far from her horizon
as possible, was forced to acknowledge this.</p>
<p>In the proudly poised head, the small,
swiftly moving hands, and the tiny feet there
was a birdlike alertness which was the epitome
of action. The supple body, however, lacked
the bird&#8217;s fluttering uncertainty; rather the
figure bespoke a control that had its birth in
an absence of all self-consciousness and the
obedience of perfectly trained muscles to a
compelling will.</p>
<p>Without a shadow of embarrassment Lucy
endured her aunt&#8217;s inspection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody&#8217;d think,&#8221; commented Ellen to
herself in a mixture of indignation and amusement,
&#8220;that she was a princess comin&#8217; a-visitin&#8217;
instead of bein&#8217; a charity orphan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet although she fumed inwardly at the
girl&#8217;s attitude, she did not really dislike it.
Spirit flashed in the youthful face, and Ellen
admired spirit. She would have scorned a
cringing, apologetic Webster. Unquestionably
in her niece&#8217;s calm assurance there was no
hint of the dependent.</p>
<p>As she stood serenely in the center of the
room, Lucy&#8217;s gaze wandered over her aunt&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
shoulder and composedly scanned every detail
of the kitchen, traveling from ceiling to floor,
examining the spotless shelves, the primly arranged
pots and pans, the gleaming tin dipper
above the sink. Then the roving eyes came
back to the older woman and settled with unconcealed
curiosity upon her lined and sharply
cut features.</p>
<p>Beneath the intentness of the scrutiny Ellen
colored uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she demanded tartly.</p>
<p>Lucy started.</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to have made up your mind
about me,&#8221; went on the rasping voice. &#8220;Am I
what <i>you</i> expected?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>The monosyllable came quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of an aunt were you lookin&#8217;
for?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy waited a moment and then replied with
childlike directness:</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d be more like Dad. And
you don&#8217;t look in the least like an invalid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re disappointed I ain&#8217;t sicker, eh?&#8221;
commented Ellen grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; answered Lucy. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad
to find you so strong. But it makes me feel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
you do not need me as much as I thought you
did. You are perfectly able to take care of
yourself without my help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can take care of myself all right,
young woman,&#8221; Ellen returned with an acid
smile. &#8220;I don&#8217;t require a nurse&mdash;at least not
yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy maintained a thoughtful silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite understand why you sent for
me,&#8221; she presently remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I write you I was lonesome?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But you&#8217;re not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen laughed in spite of herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you so sure of that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look lonesome.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the elder woman chuckled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe I do, an&#8217; mebbe I don&#8217;t,&#8221; she responded.
&#8220;Anyhow, you can&#8217;t always judge
of how folks feel by the way they look.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose not.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reply was spoken politely but without
conviction.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; besides, I had other reasons for gettin&#8217;
you here,&#8221; her aunt went on. &#8220;I mentioned
&#8217;em in my letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember the other reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen stared, aghast.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why&mdash;the property,&#8221; she managed
to stammer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words were uttered with an indifference
too genuine to be questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the property,&#8221; repeated Ellen with
cutting sarcasm. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t you interested in
money; or have you got so much already that
you couldn&#8217;t find a use for any more?&#8221;</p>
<p>The thrust told. Into the girl&#8217;s cheek surged
a flame of crimson.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any money,&#8221; she returned with
dignity. &#8220;Dad left me almost penniless.
His illness used up all we had. Nevertheless,
I was glad to spend it for his comfort, and I
can earn more when I need it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; went on Lucy, raising her chin a
trifle higher, &#8220;I am perfectly capable of supporting
myself any time I wish to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe you&#8217;d rather do that than stay here
with me,&#8221; her aunt suggested derisively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; was the simple retort. &#8220;I shall
see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen bit her lip and then for the second time
her sense of humor overcame her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess there&#8217;s no doubtin&#8217; you&#8217;re a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
genuine Webster,&#8221; she replied good-humoredly.
&#8220;I begin to think we shall get on together
nicely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a reservation in the words that
nettled Ellen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t we?&#8221; she persisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like your aunt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not altogether.&#8221;</p>
<p>The audacity of the reply appealed to the
older woman, and her eyes twinkled. &#8220;Not
altogether, eh?&#8221; she echoed. &#8220;Now I&#8217;m sorry
to hear that because I like you very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy smiled. It was a radiant smile, disclosing
prettily formed white teeth and a lurking
dimple.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to return the compliment?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was long since Ellen had been so highly
entertained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she observed with undiminished
amusement, &#8220;I&#8217;ve evidently got to be on my
good behavior if I want to keep such an independent
young lady as you in the house.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t I be independent?&#8221;</p>
<p>A few moments before Ellen would have
met the challenge with derision; but now something
caused her to restrain the retort that
trembled on her tongue and say instead:</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you&#8217;ve got a right to be independent.
The folks that ain&#8217;t ought to be
made way with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her affirmation surprised her. She would
not have confessed it, but a strange sense of
respect for the girl before her had driven her
to utter them.</p>
<p>Lucy greeted the remark graciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I think,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then at least we agree on somethin&#8217;,&#8221; returned
Ellen dryly, &#8220;an&#8217; mebbe before I put
my foot in it an&#8217; lose this bit of your good
opinion, I&#8217;d better take you up to your room.&#8221;</p>
<p>She caught up the heavy satchel from the
floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t,&#8221; Lucy protested. &#8220;Please let
me take it. I&#8217;m used to carrying heavy things.
I am very strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Strong, are you?&#8221; questioned Ellen, without,
however, turning her head or offering to
surrender the large leather holdall. &#8220;An&#8217; how,
pray, did you get so strong?&#8221; She passed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
into the hall and up the stairs as she spoke,
Lucy following.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, driving horses, doing housework, cooking,
cleaning, and shooting,&#8221; the girl replied.
Then as if a forgotten activity had come to her
mind as an afterthought, she added gaily:
&#8220;And sawing wood, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can do things like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed. I had to after Mother died
and we moved to Bald Mountain where Dad&#8217;s
mine was. I did all the work for my father
and ten Mexicans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You? Why didn&#8217;t your father get a
woman in?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy broke into a merry laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman! Why, Aunt Ellen, there wasn&#8217;t
a woman within twenty miles. It was only a
mining camp, you see; just Dad and his men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you mean to tell me you were the sole
woman in a place like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s silvery laughter floated upward.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ten Mexicans who boarded with us
were engineers and bosses,&#8221; she explained.
&#8220;There were over fifty miners in the camp besides.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stopping midway up the staircase Ellen
wheeled and said indignantly:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; Thomas kep&#8217; you in a settlement like
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twarn&#8217;t no place for a girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the place for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because Dad was there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something in the reply left Ellen wordless
and made her continue her way upstairs without
answering. When she did speak, it was to
say in a gentler tone:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe you&#8217;ll like the room I&#8217;m going to
give you. It used to belong to your Dad when
he was a little boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lifted the latch of a paneled door and
stood looking into a large bedroom. The sun
slanted across a bare, painted floor, which was
covered by a few braided rugs, old and worn;
there was a great four-poster about which were
draped chintz curtains, yellowed by age, and
between the windows stood a mahogany bureau
whose brasses were tarnished by years of service;
two stiff ladder-back chairs, a three-cornered
washstand, and a few faded photographs
in pale gilt frames completed the furnishings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>With swift step Lucy crossed the room and
gazed up at one of the pictures.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Dad!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d no idea he was ever such a chubby little
fellow. Look at his baby hands and his
drum!&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused, looking intently at the picture.
Then in a far-away tone she added:</p>
<p>&#8220;And his eyes were just the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>For several minutes she lingered, earnest
and reminiscent.</p>
<p>&#8220;And is this you, Aunt Ellen?&#8221; she asked,
motioning toward another time-dimmed likeness
hanging over the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>A silence fell upon the room. Ellen
fidgeted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve changed a good deal since then,&#8221; she
observed, after waiting nervously for some
comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve changed much more than Dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>Curiosity impelled her to cross to Lucy&#8217;s
side and examine the photograph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your eyes&mdash;your mouth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about &#8217;em?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&#8217;t believe I could explain it,&#8221;
responded Lucy slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe you&#8217;d have liked me better as
a little girl,&#8221; grinned her aunt whimsically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;yes. I&#8217;m sure I should have liked you
as a little girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reply piqued Ellen. She bent forward
and scrutinized the likeness more critically.
The picture was of a child in a low-cut print
dress and pantalettes,&mdash;a resolute figure, all
self-assurance and self-will.</p>
<p>It was easy to trace in the face the features
of the woman who confronted it: the brows of
each were high, broad, and still bordered by
smoothly parted hair; the well-formed noses,
too, were identical; but the eyes of the little
maiden in the old-fashioned gown sparkled
with an unmalicious merriment and frankness
the woman&#8217;s had lost, and the curving mouth of
the child was unmarred by bitter lines. Ellen
stirred uncomfortably.</p>
<p>As she looked she suddenly became conscious
of a desire to turn her glance away from the
calm gaze of her youthful self. Yes, the years
had indeed left their mark upon her, she inwardly
confessed. She did not look like that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
now. Lucy was right. Her eyes had changed,
and her mouth, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Folks grow old,&#8221; she murmured peevishly.
&#8220;Nobody can expect to keep on looking as
they did when they were ten years old.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abruptly she moved toward the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s water in the pitcher, an&#8217; there&#8217;s
soap and towels here, I guess,&#8221; she remarked.
&#8220;When you get fixed up, come downstairs;
supper&#8217;ll be on the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>The door banged and she was gone. But as
she moved alone about the kitchen she was still
haunted by the clear, questioning eyes of the
child in the photograph upstairs. They
seemed to follow her accusingly, reproachfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drat old pictures!&#8221; she at last burst out
angrily. &#8220;They&#8217;d ought to be burnt up&mdash;the
whole lot of them! They always set you
thinkin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE EPISODE OF THE EGGS</h3>
</div>

<p>The next morning while Ellen stood at the
kitchen table slicing bread for breakfast, Lucy,
her figure girlish in a blue and white pinafore,
appeared in the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Aunt Ellen,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You will have to forgive me this once for being
late. Everything was so still I didn&#8217;t
wake up. Your nice feather bed was too comfortable,
I&#8217;m afraid. But it shan&#8217;t happen
again. After this I mean to be prompt as the
sun, for I&#8217;m going to be the one to get the
breakfast. You must promise to let me do it.
I&#8217;d love to. I am quite accustomed to getting
up early, and after serving breakfast for
twelve, breakfast for two looks like nothing at
all.&#8221; As she spoke she moved with buoyant
step across the room to the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shan&#8217;t I toast the bread?&#8221; she inquired.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to toast it,&#8221; returned Ellen
in a curt tone. &#8220;Hot bread an&#8217; melted butter&#8217;s
bad for folks, &#8217;specially in the mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy smiled. &#8220;It never hurts me,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor me,&#8221; put in her aunt quickly. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t give it a chance to. But whether or no,
I don&#8217;t have it. When you melt butter all up,
you use twice as much, an&#8217; there ain&#8217;t no use
wastin&#8217; food.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought about the butter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Them as has the least in the world is the
ones that generally toss the most money away,&#8221;
the elder woman observed.</p>
<p>The transient kindliness of the night before
had vanished, giving place to her customary
sharpness of tone. Lucy paid no heed to the
innuendo.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might make an omelet while I&#8217;m waiting,&#8221;
she suggested pleasantly. &#8220;Dad used
to think I made quite a nice one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have eggs in the mornin&#8217;, either,&#8221;
replied Ellen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like eggs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t eat &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How funny! I always have an egg for
breakfast.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t here,&#8221; came crisply from her
aunt.</p>
<p>Lucy failed to catch the gist of the remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I thought you kept hens,&#8221; she said
innocently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see. They&#8217;re not laying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they are. I get about four dozen
eggs every day,&#8221; retorted Ellen. &#8220;But I sell
&#8217;em instead of eatin&#8217; &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>As comprehension dawned upon Lucy, she
was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Folks don&#8217;t need eggs in the mornin&#8217; anyway,&#8221;
continued Ellen, still on the defensive.
&#8220;This stuffin&#8217; yourself with food is all habit.
Anybody can get into the way of eatin&#8217; more
&#8217;n&#8217; more, an&#8217; not know where to stop. Bread
an&#8217; coffee an&#8217; oatmeal is all anybody needs for
breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>If she expected a reply from her niece, she
was disappointed, for Lucy did not speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you can get sixty-six cents a dozen
for eggs, it&#8217;s no time to be eatin&#8217; &#8217;em,&#8221; Ellen
continued irritably. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t come to live
with a Rockefeller, Miss.&#8221;</p>
<p>Receiving no answer to the quip, she drew
a chair to the table and sat down.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better come an&#8217; get your coffee
while it&#8217;s hot,&#8221; she called to Lucy.</p>
<p>Slowly the girl approached the table and
seated herself opposite her aunt.</p>
<p>The window confronting her framed a scene
of rare beauty. The Webster farm stood high
on a plateau, and beneath it lay a broad sweep
of valley, now half-shrouded in the silver mists
of early morning. The near-at-hand field and
pasture that sloped toward it were gemmed
with dew. Every blade of tall grass of the
mowing sparkled. Even the long rows of
green shoots striping the chocolate earth of the
garden flashed emerald in the morning sunlight;
beyond the plowed land, through an orchard
whose apple boughs were studded with
ruby buds, Lucy caught a glimpse of a square
brick chimney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who lives in the next house?&#8221; she inquired,
in an attempt to turn the unpleasant tide of the
conversation. If she had felt resentment at
her aunt&#8217;s remarks, she at least did not show it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was wondering who lived in the next
house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Howes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not realize last night that you had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
neighbors so near at hand,&#8221; continued the girl
brightly. &#8220;Tell me about them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothin&#8217; to tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean who is in the family?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Martin Howe an&#8217; his three sisters,
if that&#8217;s what you want to know,&#8221; snapped
Ellen.</p>
<p>Lucy, however, was not to be rebuffed. She
attributed her aunt&#8217;s ungraciousness to her
irritation about the breakfast and, determining
to remain unruffled, she went on patiently:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice for you to have them so near,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t make no difference to me, their
bein&#8217; there. I don&#8217;t know &#8217;em.&#8221; For some
reason that Lucy could not fathom, the woman&#8217;s
temper seemed to be rising, and being a person
of tact she promptly shifted the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter about the Howes any more,
Aunt Ellen,&#8221; she said, smiling into the other&#8217;s
frowning face. &#8220;Tell me instead what you
want me to do to help you to-day? Now that
I&#8217;m here you must divide the work with me so
I may have my share.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Ellen did not return the smile, the
scowl on her forehead relaxed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find plenty to keep you busy, I
guess,&#8221; she returned. &#8220;There&#8217;s all the housework
to be done&mdash;dishes, beds, an&#8217; sweepin&#8217;;
an&#8217; then there&#8217;s milk to set an&#8217; skim; eggs to
collect an&#8217; pack for market; hens to feed;
an&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t so keen on dividin&#8217; up, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t that,&#8221; returned Lucy quickly.
&#8220;I was only thinking what a lot you had to do.
No wonder you sent for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a random remark, but it struck
Ellen&#8217;s conscience with such aplomb that she
flushed, dismayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she faltered.</p>
<p>As Lucy looked at her aunt, she observed the
shifting glance, the crafty smile, the nervous
interlacing of the fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mean?&#8221; she returned innocently. &#8220;Why,
nothing, Aunt Ellen. We must all work for a
living one way or another, I suppose. If I
prefer to stay here with you and earn my board
there is no disgrace in it, is there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless Ellen was obviously disconcerted.
There was an uncanny quality in
Lucy that left her with a sense that every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
hiding place in her heart was laid bare. Were
the girl&#8217;s ingenuous observations as ingenuous
as they seemed? Or were they the result of
an abnormal intuition, a superhuman power
for fathoming the souls of others?</p>
<p>Eager to escape the youthful seer, the woman
pushed back her chair and rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go out an&#8217; see what that boy Tony&#8217;s
up to,&#8221; she said. &#8220;While I&#8217;m gone you might
tidy up round here a bit. There&#8217;s the dishes
an&#8217; the beds; an&#8217; in the pantry you&#8217;ll find the
eggs with the cases to pack &#8217;em in. An&#8217; if you
get round to it you might sweep up the sittin&#8217;
room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Drawing on a worn coat Ellen moved toward
the door; when, however, her hand was
on the knob, she turned and called over her
shoulder:</p>
<p>&#8220;The washin&#8217;s soakin&#8217; in the tubs in the
shed. You can hang it out if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy waited until she saw the angular
figure wend its way to the barn. Then she
broke into a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old fox! She did get me here to work
for her,&#8221; she murmured aloud. &#8220;Anyway, I
don&#8217;t have to stay unless I like; and I shan&#8217;t,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
either. So, Aunt Ellen Webster, you&#8217;d better
be careful how you treat me.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a defiant shake of her miniature fist in
the direction her aunt had taken, Lucy turned
to attack the duties before her. She washed
the dishes and put them away; tripped upstairs
and kneaded the billowy feather beds into
smoothness; and humming happily, she swept
and polished the house until it shone. She did
such things well and delighted in the miracles
her small hands wrought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for the eggs!&#8221; she exclaimed, opening
the pantry door.</p>
<p>Yes, there were the empty cases, and there
on the shelf were the eggs that waited to be
packed,&mdash;dozens of them. It seemed at first
glance as if there must be thousands.</p>
<p>&#8220;And she wouldn&#8217;t let me have one!&#8221; ejaculated
the girl. &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want them.
But I&#8217;m going to have an egg for breakfast
whether she likes it or not. I&#8217;ll buy some.
Then I can eat them without thanks to her. I
have a little money, and I may as well spend
part of it that way as not. I suppose it will
annoy her; but I can&#8217;t help it. I&#8217;m not going
to starve to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>During this half-humorous, half-angry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
soliloquy, Lucy was packing the eggs for
market, packing them with extreme care.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to smash them all,&#8221; she declared,
dimpling. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be fun! But I
won&#8217;t. I&#8217;ll not break one if I can help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deft fingers successfully carried out this
resolution. When Ellen returned from the
garden at noontime, not only was the housework
done, but the eggs were in the cases; the
clothes swaying on the line; and the dinner
steaming on the table. She was in high good
humor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot to ask you what you had planned
for us to have this noon,&#8221; explained Lucy.
&#8220;So I had to rummage through the refrigerator
and use my own judgment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your judgment seems to have been pretty
good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Websters always had good judgment,&#8221;
the woman observed, as she dropped
wearily into a chair. &#8220;Yes, you&#8217;ve got together
a very good meal. It&#8217;s most too good,
though. Next time you needn&#8217;t get so
much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy regarded her aunt mischievously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably if I&#8217;d been all Webster I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
shouldn&#8217;t have,&#8221; she remarked demurely.
&#8220;But half of me, you see, is Duquesne, and the
Duquesnes were generous providers.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Ellen sensed this jocose rebuke, she at
least neither resented it nor paid the slightest
heed to its innuendo.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Duquesnes?&#8221; she questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother was a Duquesne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she was?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you know that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I reckon I did at the time your father
married, but I&#8217;d forgot about it. Thomas an&#8217;
I didn&#8217;t write much to one another, an&#8217; latterly
I didn&#8217;t hear from him at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a pity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno as it made much difference,&#8221; Ellen
said. &#8220;Likely he didn&#8217;t remember much about
his home an&#8217; his relations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed he did,&#8221; cried Lucy eagerly.
&#8220;He used to speak often of my grandparents
and the old house, and he hoped I&#8217;d come East
sometime and see the place where he had lived
as a boy. As he grew older and was sick, I
think his early home came to mean more to him
than any other spot on earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer how it often takes folks to their
dyin&#8217; day to get any sense,&#8221; declared Ellen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
caustically. &#8220;Where&#8217;d your father pick up
your mother, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy did not answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean where did he get acquainted with
her?&#8221; amended Ellen hastily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never heard the story?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it was the sweetest thing,&#8221; began Lucy
enthusiastically. &#8220;You see, Grandfather Duquesne
owned a coal mine up in the mountains,
and Dad worked for him. One day one of the
cages used in going down into the mine got out
of order, and Grandfather gave orders that it
was to be fixed right away lest some accident
occur and the men be injured. But through a
misunderstanding the work was not done, and
the next day the cage dropped and killed nine
of the miners. Of course the men blamed poor
Grandfather for the tragedy, and they marched
to his house, intending to drag him out and
lynch him. Dad knew the truth, however, and
he rushed to the place and held the mob back
with his pistol until he could tell them the real
facts. At first they were so angry they refused
to listen, but by and by they did, and instead
of killing Grandfather they went and
found the engineers who were to blame.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>Ellen waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did they do to them?&#8221; she demanded
at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they hung them instead of Grandfather,&#8221;
answered Lucy simply.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Three or four, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was evident that Lucy was quite indifferent
to the fate of the unlucky engineers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy on us!&#8221; Ellen gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;But their carelessness caused the death of
the other men. It was only fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s the way you settle things in the
West?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. At least, they did then.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mountain-bred girl obviously saw nothing
amiss in this swift-footed justice.</p>
<p>&#8220;And where did your mother come in?&#8221;
asked her aunt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you see, Grandfather Duquesne
afterward made Dad the boss of the mine, and
when Mother, a girl of sixteen, came home
from the California convent, where she had
been at school, she saw him and fell in love
with him. Grandfather Duquesne made an
awful fuss, but he let her marry him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>Lucy threw back her head with one of her
rippling laughs.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had to,&#8221; she added merrily. &#8220;Mother&#8217;d
have married Dad anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen studied the tea grounds in the bottom
of her cup thoughtfully.</p>
<p>How strange it was to picture Thomas the
hero of a romance like this! She had heard
that once in his life every man became a poet;
probably this was Thomas&#8217;s era of transformation.</p>
<p>Her reverie was broken by the gentle voice
of Lucy, who observed:</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d do, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; inquired Ellen vaguely. In her
reverie about Thomas she had lost the connection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marry the man I loved no matter what
anybody said. Wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&#8217;t know,&#8221; stammered Ellen,
getting to her feet with embarrassment at having
a love affair thrust so intimately upon her.
&#8220;Mebbe. I must go back now to Tony an&#8217;
the weedin&#8217;. When you get cleared up round
here, there&#8217;s plenty of mendin&#8217; to be done.
You&#8217;ll find that hamper full of stockin&#8217;s to be
darned.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>After Ellen had gone out, Lucy did not rise
immediately from the table, but sat watching
the clouds that foamed up behind the maples
on the crest of the nearby hill. A glory of
sunshine bathed the earth, and she could see
the coral of the apple buds sway against the
sky. It was no day to sit within doors and
darn socks. All Nature beckoned, and to
Lucy, used from birth to being in the open,
the alluring gesture was irresistible.</p>
<p>With sudden resolve she sprang up, cleared
away the confused remnants of the meal before
her, dashed to her room for a scarlet sweater,
and fled into the radiant world outside.</p>
<p>She followed the driveway until it joined the
road, and then, after hesitating an instant,
turned in the direction of the Howe farm. A
mischievous light danced in her brown eyes,
and a smile curved her lips.</p>
<p>The road along which she passed was bordered
on either side by walls of gray stone covered
with shiny-leaved ivy and flanked by a
checkerboard of pastures roughly dotted with
clumps of hardback and boles of protruding
rock. Great brakes grew in the shady hollows,
and from the woods beyond came the cool,
moist perfume of moss and ferns.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>The girl looked about her with delight.
Then she began to sing softly to herself and
jingle rhythmically the coins in her pocket.</p>
<p>It was nearly a quarter of a mile to the
Howes&#8217; gate, and by the time she reached it,
her swinging step had given to her cheek a
color that even the apple orchard could not
rival.</p>
<p>A quick tap on the knocker brought Mary
Howe to the door. She was tall, angular, and
short-sighted, and she stood regarding her visitor
inquisitively, her forehead lined by a network
of wrinkles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you let me have a dozen eggs?&#8221;
asked Lucy.</p>
<p>Mary looked at the girl in waiting silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Miss Webster&#8217;s niece,&#8221; explained
Lucy, with an appealing smile. &#8220;We live
next door, you know. Aunt Ellen didn&#8217;t seem
to have any eggs to spare, so&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she
stopped, arrested by Mary&#8217;s expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you don&#8217;t sell eggs,&#8221; she ventured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we do,&#8221; Mary contrived to articulate,
&#8220;but I don&#8217;t know&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She
broke off helplessly in the midst of the disjointed
sentence and, raising her voice, called:
&#8220;Eliza, is Jane there?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s upstairs. I&#8217;ll fetch her down,&#8221; responded
Eliza, coming to the door. &#8220;What
is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Miss Webster&#8217;s niece askin&#8217; for
eggs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Webster&#8217;s niece! Ellen Webster&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>The explanation had in it an intonation of
terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My land, Mary! What shall we do?
Martin will never&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; the awed whisper
ceased. &#8220;I&#8217;ll call Jane,&#8221; broke off Eliza hurriedly.</p>
<p>Lucy heard the messenger speed across the
floor and run up the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m making you a great deal of
trouble,&#8221; she remarked apologetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you haven&#8217;t any eggs to spare.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary did not reply to the words; instead she
continued to look with bewilderment at the
girl on the doorstep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Miss Webster send you?&#8221; she at last
inquired.</p>
<p>Lucy laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;She didn&#8217;t
even know I was coming. You see, I only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
arrived from Arizona last night. I&#8217;ve come to
live with my aunt. We didn&#8217;t seem to agree
very well about breakfast this morning so
I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>The explanation was pregnant with understanding.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just thought I&#8217;d feel more independent
if I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A swish of skirts cut short the sentence, and
in another moment all three of the Howe sisters
were framed in the doorway.</p>
<p>Although a certain family resemblance was
characteristic of them, they looked little alike.
Eliza, it was true, was less angular than Mary
and lacked her firmness of mouth and chin; but
nevertheless the Howe stamp was upon her
black hair, heavy, bushy brows, and noble cast
of forehead. It was Jane&#8217;s face, touched by
a humor the others could not boast, that instantly
arrested Lucy&#8217;s attention. It was a
fine, almost classic countenance which bespoke
high thinking and a respect for its own soul.
The eyes were gray and kindly, and in contrast
to the undisguised dismay of her sisters,
Jane&#8217;s attitude was one of unruffled composure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You want some eggs?&#8221; she began with
directness.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can spare a dozen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Jane&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; interrupted Mary nervously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do be careful, Jane,&#8221; chimed in Eliza.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a right to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; but the resolute Jane
was not permitted to finish her declaration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin won&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; interpolated Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know Martin will be dretful put out,&#8221;
protested Eliza at the same instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it if he is,&#8221; asserted Jane impatiently.
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t obliged to think as he does,
am I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be&mdash;oh, Jane!&#8221; Eliza implored.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take all the blame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;ll say,&#8221; pleaded
Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to get the eggs, anyhow,&#8221;
announced Jane, cutting short further argument
by moving away.</p>
<p>During this enigmatic dialogue, Lucy&#8217;s mystified
gaze traveled from the face of one woman
to that of another. What was it all about?
And who was this Martin that he should inspire
such terror?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; she called to the retreating
Jane, &#8220;you&#8217;d rather not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, my dear,&#8221; replied Jane cordially.
&#8220;We&#8217;re glad to let you have the eggs.
I&#8217;ll get them right away. It won&#8217;t take me a
second.&#8221;</p>
<p>She disappeared behind the paneled door at
the end of the hall, and presently Mary and
Eliza, who had loitered irresolutely, uncertain
whether to go or stay, followed her.</p>
<p>Left to herself, Lucy looked idly across the
sunny landscape. Against the sky line at the
top of the hill she could see a tall, masculine
figure delving in the garden.</p>
<p>&#8220;That must be Martin-the-Terrible,&#8221; she
observed. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t look like such an
ogre.&#8221;</p>
<p>The banging of the door heralded Jane&#8217;s
approach. She held in her hand a neatly tied
package, and over her shoulders peered Mary
and Eliza.</p>
<p>&#8220;The eggs will be sixty-seven cents,&#8221; Jane
said in a businesslike tone. &#8220;That is the regular
market price. I&#8217;d carry the box this side
up if I were you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy counted the change into the woman&#8217;s
palm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have such a pretty home,&#8221; she murmured
as she did so.</p>
<p>&#8220;We like it,&#8221; replied Jane pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder. The view from this porch
is beautiful. Sometime I hope you&#8217;ll let me
come over and see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy heard two faint simultaneous gasps.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be glad to have you,&#8221; came steadily
from Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;d like you to come over and see me
some day, too&mdash;all of you,&#8221; went on the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have much time for goin&#8217; out,&#8221;
returned Jane. &#8220;There&#8217;s such a lot to do
that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she stopped, appearing for the first
time to be confused.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know there is,&#8221; Lucy assented serenely.
&#8220;I am afraid I have kept you too long from
your work as it is. You must forgive me.
Thank you very much for the eggs.&#8221;</p>
<p>She extended a slender hand, which Jane
grasped warmly. A smile passed between the
two.</p>
<p>But as Lucy turned down the driveway and
the door of the Howe homestead closed, a
tragic babel of voices reached her ear, piping
in shrill staccato the single word:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Jane!</i>&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>A CLASH OF WILLS</h3>
</div>

<p>When Lucy reached home she found her
aunt in the sitting room bending disapprovingly
over the basket of undarned stockings.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you haven&#8217;t touched these,&#8221; she observed,
in a chiding tone. &#8220;Where&#8217;ve you
been?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I went to get some eggs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eggs! What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For my breakfast to-morrow. You said
you couldn&#8217;t spare any, so I&#8217;ve bought some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>The word expressed mingled wrath and
wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next door.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman looked puzzled. She thought a
moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d you say?&#8221; she asked after a
pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next door&mdash;at the Howes&#8217;.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The Howes&#8217;!&#8221; Ellen fairly hissed the
name. &#8220;You went to the <i>Howes&#8217;</i> for eggs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>With a swift motion her aunt strode forward
and snatched the box from Lucy&#8217;s light grasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;You went to the Howes&mdash;to the Howes&mdash;an&#8217;
told &#8217;em I didn&#8217;t give you enough to eat?&#8221;</p>
<p>Livid, the woman crowded nearer, clutching
the girl&#8217;s arm in a fierce, merciless grip; her
blue eyes flashed, and her lips trembled with
anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say you didn&#8217;t give me enough to
eat,&#8221; explained Lucy, trying unsuccessfully to
draw away from the cruel fingers that held her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you tell &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I just said you couldn&#8217;t spare any eggs for
us to use.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spare eggs! I can spare all the eggs I
like,&#8221; Ellen retorted. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t a pauper. If
I chose I could eat every egg there is in that
pantry.&#8221; She shook her niece viciously. &#8220;I
only sell my eggs &#8217;cause I&#8217;d rather,&#8221; she went
on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you said we couldn&#8217;t afford to
have eggs when they where so high,&#8221; explained
Lucy. &#8220;You said they were sixty-six cents a
dozen.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I could afford to eat &#8217;em if they was a dollar,&#8221;
interrupted Ellen, her voice rising. &#8220;If
they were two dollars!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t your business to understand,&#8221;
snapped her aunt. &#8220;Your business is to do as
I say. Think of your goin&#8217; to the Howes&mdash;to
the Howes of all people&mdash;an&#8217; askin&#8217; for eggs!
It&#8217;ll be nuts for them. <i>The Howes.</i>&#8221; The
circling fingers loosened weakly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;the Howes
sold you any eggs. They wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; done it,
you may be sure, but to spite me. I reckon
they were only too glad to take the chance you
offered &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They weren&#8217;t glad,&#8221; protested Lucy indignantly.
&#8220;They didn&#8217;t want to sell the eggs at
all, at least two of them didn&#8217;t; but the one
called Jane insisted on letting me have
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d they say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t understand,&#8221; Lucy replied.
&#8220;They seemed to be afraid of displeasing
somebody called Martin. They said he
wouldn&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin wouldn&#8217;t, eh?&#8221; Ellen gave a disagreeable
chuckle. &#8220;They&#8217;re right there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
Martin won&#8217;t like it. They&#8217;ll be lucky if he
doesn&#8217;t flay them alive for&#8217; doin&#8217; it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why, Aunt Ellen? Why?&#8221; inquired
Lucy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the Howes hate us, root an&#8217;
branch; because they&#8217;ve injured an&#8217; insulted us
for generations, an&#8217; are keepin&#8217; right on injurin&#8217;
an&#8217; insultin&#8217; us. That&#8217;s why!&#8221; Ellen&#8217;s
wrath, which had waned a little, again rose to a
white heat. &#8220;Because they&#8217;d go any length
to do us harm&mdash;every one of &#8217;em.&#8221; Again the
grip on Lucy&#8217;s arm tightened painfully.</p>
<p>Dragging the girl to the window the old
woman cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see that pile of stones over there?
That&#8217;s the wall the Howes built years an&#8217; years
ago&mdash;built because of the grudge they bore the
Websters, likely. Did you ever look on such
an eyesore?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t they fix it?&#8221; asked Lucy
naively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, why don&#8217;t they? You may well ask
that!&#8221; returned Ellen with scathing bitterness.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t they? Because they&#8217;re too
mean an&#8217; stingy&mdash;that&#8217;s why. Because they
think that by lettin&#8217; it go to ruin an&#8217; makin&#8217; my
place look like a dump heap, they can drive me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
to spend my money to do it, so&#8217;st they can save
theirs. Because they&#8217;re such lyin&#8217;, deceitful
critters they actually pretend the wall don&#8217;t
belong to &#8217;em anyhow&mdash;that it&#8217;s mine! <i>Mine!</i>
That&#8217;s why. So they leave it there, lookin&#8217;
like the devil&#8217;s own playground, hopin&#8217; that
some day I&#8217;ll get so sick of seem&#8217; it that way
that I&#8217;ll build it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>She choked for breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I shan&#8217;t,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;I never
shall, long&#8217;s I live. If I was to be drawn an&#8217;
quartered I wouldn&#8217;t do it. No. If Martin
Howe thinks he&#8217;s the only person in the world
who can hold out for a principle, he&#8217;s mistaken.
I&#8217;ve got a will that can match his, match his
an&#8217; beat it, too, an&#8217; he&#8217;ll learn it sometime. I
can put up with seein&#8217; that wall just as long as
he can.&#8221;</p>
<p>A light of understanding began to break in
on Lucy&#8217;s bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she began, then halted
before her aunt&#8217;s stern gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t see what? Out with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you couldn&#8217;t build it up
together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t!&#8221; sneered Ellen contemptuously,
&#8220;You&#8217;d help those Howes fix their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
wall, I s&#8217;pose, same&#8217;s you&#8217;d go an&#8217; buy their
eggs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The withering intonation of the words
echoed through the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to tell you right now, Lucy Webster,
that if you have a spark of pride, an atom
of regard for your father, your grandfather,
or your great-grandfather, you&#8217;ll put all such
notions as that plumb out of your head.
You&#8217;ll have no dealin&#8217;s with the Howes.
You&#8217;ll just hate &#8217;em as your folks have always
hated &#8217;em; an&#8217; you&#8217;ll vow from now on
that if Heaven ever gives you the chance
you&#8217;ll get even with &#8217;em.&#8221; The tense voice
ceased.</p>
<p>Through the stillness the whispers of the
great elm on the lawn could be heard blending
with the song of a vesper sparrow. Already
twilight had folded the valley in mystery until
only the peaks of the hills were tipped with
light.</p>
<p>Contrasted with the peace of the night,
man&#8217;s strivings seemed peculiarly out of harmony.
But to Ellen&#8217;s heart the scene brought
no tranquillity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you know what your duty is,&#8221; she
concluded, with a final vindictive outburst.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If it is my duty,&#8221; the girl answered, her
eyes still upon the distant landscape.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s your duty. There ain&#8217;t no
question about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Each of us must settle with his own conscience
what his duty is,&#8221; Lucy observed slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if it&#8217;s been handed down to him,&#8221; put
in Ellen quickly. &#8220;I guess your duty&#8217;s
chalked out for you pretty plain; an&#8217; I reckon
if you&#8217;re any sort of a Webster you&#8217;ll do it an&#8217;
not go branchin&#8217; off followin&#8217; notions of your
own&mdash;not after all these years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in keeping up traditions unless
they are good ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>The older woman&#8217;s lips tightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you&#8217;d break off from what your
folks thought?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I felt it to be right, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen drew a quick, impatient breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to say you&#8217;d set yourself up as
knowin&#8217; mor&#8217;n your people before you did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe each generation grows wiser, or
ought to&mdash;wiser and kinder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kindness has nothin&#8217; to do with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it has,&#8221; persisted Lucy softly. &#8220;Unless
we become more kind, how is the world
ever to become better?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pish!&#8221; ejaculated Ellen. &#8220;Now see here.
You ain&#8217;t comin&#8217; into my house to preach to
me. I&#8217;m older&#8217;n you, an&#8217; I know without bein&#8217;
told what I want to do. So long&#8217;s you stay
under this roof you&#8217;ll behave like a Webster&mdash;that&#8217;s
all I&#8217;ve got to say. If you ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217;
to be a Webster an&#8217; prefer to disgrace your
kin, the sooner you get out the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. I can go.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no bravado in the assertion. Had
there been, Ellen would not have felt so much
alarmed. It was the fearless sincerity of the
remark that frightened her. She had not intended
to force a crisis. She had calculated
that her bullying tone would cow rather than
antagonize her niece. The last result on which
she had reckoned was defiance. Instantly
her crafty mind recognized that she must conciliate
unless she would lose this valuable helper
whose toil could be secured without expense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I don&#8217;t mean&mdash;I wouldn&#8217;t want
you should go away,&#8221; she hastened to declare.
&#8220;I&#8217;m just anxious for you to do&mdash;well&mdash;what&#8217;s
right,&#8221; she concluded lamely.</p>
<p>Lucy saw her advantage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Aunt Ellen, we may as well settle
this right now,&#8221; she asserted. &#8220;I am quite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
willing to go back to Arizona any time you say
the word. I have no desire to remain where I
am not wanted. But so long as I do stay here,
I must be the one to decide what it is right for
me to do. Remember, I am not a child. I
have a conscience as well as you, and I am old
enough to use it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen did not speak. She realized that
Greek had met Greek and in the combat of
wills she was vanquished. Nevertheless, she
was not generous enough to own defeat.</p>
<p>&#8220;S&#8217;pose we don&#8217;t talk about it any more,&#8221;
she replied diplomatically.</p>
<p>She was retreating toward the door, still
smarting under the knowledge of having been
vanquished, when her eye fell upon the box of
eggs, which, in her excitement, she had forgotten
was in her hand. A malicious gleam
lighted her face. A second afterward there
was a violent crash in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;The eggs!&#8221; Lucy heard her cry. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
dropped &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>The eggs had indeed been dropped,&mdash;dropped
with such a force that even the cooperation
of all the king&#8217;s horses and all the
king&#8217;s men would have been useless.</p>
<p>When Lucy reached her side Ellen was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
bending over the wreck on the floor, a sly smile
on her lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re gone, every one of &#8217;em,&#8221; she announced
with feigned regret. &#8220;But it ain&#8217;t
any matter. You can have all, the eggs you
want anytime you want &#8217;em. I ain&#8217;t so poverty-stricken
that we can&#8217;t have eggs&mdash;even if
they are sixty-six cents a dozen.&#8221;</p>
<p>She got a cloth and began to wipe up the
unsightly mass at her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I paid sixty-seven cents for those,&#8221; Lucy
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sixty-seven cents! How long have the
Howes been gettin&#8217; sixty-seven cents for their
eggs, I&#8217;d like to know?&#8221; Ellen demanded,
springing into an upright position.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t say. Jane told me that was the
regular market price.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t I know it?&#8221; her aunt burst
out. &#8220;They must &#8217;a&#8217; gone up a cent, an&#8217; I
sellin&#8217; mine at the store for sixty-six! Ain&#8217;t
it just like that meachin&#8217; Elias Barnes to do
me out of a penny a dozen, the skinflint.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the face of the present issue, the battle
between Howe and Webster was forgotten.</p>
<p>To be cheated out of a cent by Elias Barnes
and at the same time to have her business
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
ability surpassed by that of Martin Howe! No
indignity could have equaled it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll get even with Elias,&#8221; she blustered.
&#8220;I&#8217;m fattening some hogs for him, an&#8217;
I&#8217;ll tuck what I&#8217;ve lost on the eggs right on to
&#8217;em. He shall pay that cent one way or
&#8217;nother &#8217;fore he gets through. He needs to
think to beat me. Sixty-seven cents, and I
never knowin&#8217; it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the words brought still another bitter
possibility to the woman&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t mention to the Howes I was
gettin&#8217; only sixty-six cents a dozen for eggs,
did you?&#8221; she asked, wheeling on Lucy.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t speak of price.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; said her aunt, slightly mollified.
&#8220;At least Martin Howe can&#8217;t go crowin&#8217;
over me&mdash;that is, unless Elias Barnes tells him.
&#8217;Twould be exactly like Elias to do it. He is
just that mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Ellen did not own it, Lucy knew
that had the case been reversed, she would have
been the first to crow unhesitatingly not only
over Elias but over Martin. Pityingly she
looked at the old woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you ever get the chance to speak to those
Howe women again,&#8221; her aunt concluded, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
affected nonchalance, &#8220;you might tell &#8217;em we
never used their eggs. You could say I
smashed &#8217;em. I&#8217;d like Martin Howe to know
it.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>ELLEN ENCOUNTERS AN ENIGMA</h3>
</div>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of this bellicose admonition,
Lucy had no opportunity during the
next few weeks to deliver to the Howes her
aunt&#8217;s message, for Ellen, feeling that she was
now blessed with an able assistant whose time
must not be wasted, seized upon the mild May
weather to deluge her home from top to bottom
with soapsuds, sapolio, and fresh paint.
From morning until night Lucy worked,
scrubbing and scouring, brushing and beating.</p>
<p>As she toiled up the stairs, carrying pails of
steaming water, she caught through the windows
glimpses of the valley, its verdant depths
threaded by the river&#8217;s silvery windings. The
heavens had never been bluer. Everywhere
gladness was in the air, and the thrill of it filled
the girl with longing to be in the heart of its
magic.</p>
<p>Ellen, however, was entirely oblivious to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
miracle taking place in the universe about her.
The glory of the awakening season, with its
hosts of unfurling leaves and opening buds,
was nothing to her. Had she not been dependent
on the sun to make her garden grow,
she would probably never have lifted her face
to its golden rays. Only as nature furthered
her projects did she acknowledge its presence.</p>
<p>The Howes seemed, to some extent at least,
to share this disregard for the out-of-door
world, for like Ellen they, too, surrendered
themselves to a household upheaval quite as
merciless as that of the Websters. No sooner
would Martin disappear with horse and plow
in the direction of the garden than the three
sisters could be seen feverishly dragging mattresses
on to the piazza roof for a sunning;
shaking blankets; and beating rugs.</p>
<p>Now and then, when the sound of their
measured blows reached Ellen&#8217;s ears, she would
leap to close the windows on the side of the
house where there was danger of the Howe
germs drifting in and polluting the Webster
Lares and Penates.</p>
<p>It was one day after being thus impelled that
Lucy was surprised to see her linger and stare
intently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What are them women a-doin&#8217;?&#8221; she
exclaimed at last. &#8220;Do come here,
Lucy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Discarding her mop, the girl crossed the
room.</p>
<p>Through the gaps in the trees Mary, Eliza,
and Jane Howe were plainly visible. They
had shovels in their hands and were struggling
with the turf at the foot of the big linden tree
beside the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;They seem to be digging a hole,&#8221; Lucy
said, after watching a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for, do you suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen fidgeted at the casement for a short
time and then disappeared, only to return with
an old pair of field glasses. Adjusting them
to her eyes, she stared at her neighbors with
unconcealed curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;They <i>are</i> diggin&#8217; a hole,&#8221; she declared presently.
&#8220;A good deep one; whatever can they
be settin&#8217; out to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>For an interval she looked on with interest.
Then suddenly she exclaimed in an excited
voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re goin&#8217; to bury somethin&#8217;! My
land! What do you s&#8217;pose it is? Somethin&#8217;
all done up in a bag!&#8221; She forced the binoculars
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
into Lucy&#8217;s hand. &#8220;You look and see if
you can&#8217;t make out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy scanned the scene with mild inquisitiveness.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have a canvas sack,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
evidently they are trying to bury it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She handed the glass back to Ellen.</p>
<p>&#8220;They act as if they were in an almighty
hurry,&#8221; observed Ellen, as she looked. &#8220;They
keep watchin&#8217; to see if anybody&#8217;s comin&#8217;.
Likely they&#8217;re afraid Martin will catch &#8217;em. I
wish he would. What do you reckon is in that
bag? I&#8217;d give worlds to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy had returned to her cleaning and was
busy wringing out the mop. The doings of
the women next door failed to interest her.
But not so Ellen who, tense with speculation,
hovered at the casement.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got the hole dug,&#8221; she announced
triumphantly, &#8220;an&#8217; they&#8217;re lowerin&#8217; the bag
into it. It must be heavy &#8217;cause they seem to
be havin&#8217; a hard time lettin&#8217; it down in. They
act as if they were afraid to touch the thing.
What can it be?&#8221; she repeated for the twentieth
time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Lucy replied wearily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>She was tired and hungry and wished Ellen
would abandon spying on her neighbors and
give her a helping hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; commented Ellen from the window,
&#8220;those women handle that bag as if they had
a chiny image in it. I can&#8217;t for the life of me
figger out what can be in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>For an interval there was silence. Lucy set
the mop and pail out in the hall and began to
clean the paint.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve started to cover it up,&#8221; chronicled
Ellen, after a pause. &#8220;They&#8217;re shovelin&#8217; in
the dirt&mdash;at least Mary and Jane are; Eliza&#8217;s
stopped helpin&#8217; &#8217;em an&#8217; gone to see if anybody&#8217;s
comin&#8217;. There&#8217;s somethin&#8217; dretful
queer about it all. Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered Lucy a trifle impatiently.</p>
<p>Again Ellen studied the distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; she cried an instant later. &#8220;Look!
&#8217;Liza&#8217;s callin&#8217; an&#8217; motionin&#8217; to &#8217;em. They&#8217;re
droppin&#8217; their shovels and runnin&#8217; for the house
like a lot of scared sheep. Probably Martin&#8217;s
comin&#8217;, an&#8217; they don&#8217;t want him to catch &#8217;em.
There! What did I tell you? It <i>is</i> Martin.
I can see him drivin&#8217; over the hill. Watch &#8217;em
skitter!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>Lured more by the desire to see Martin than
to observe his panic-stricken sisters, Lucy went
to the window. It was even as Ellen had said.
There were the retreating forms of the three
female Howes disappearing in at the side door;
and there was Martin, his tall figure looming
in sight at the heels of his bay mare.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a fine looking man, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221; Lucy
remarked with thoughtless impulsiveness.</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say he is fine looking,&#8221; repeated the girl.
&#8220;What broad shoulders he has, and how magnificently
he carries his head!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You call that fine looking, do you?&#8221; sniffed
her aunt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin Howe ain&#8217;t my style of man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s so strong and splendid!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw a splendid Howe yet,&#8221; was
Ellen&#8217;s icy retort.</p>
<p>She turned from the window, took up a
cloth, and went to scrubbing the paint
viciously.</p>
<p>Lucy, realizing the tactlessness of her observation,
tried by light, good-humored chatter
to efface its memory; but all attempts to blot
it from her aunt&#8217;s mind were useless, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
relations between the two women remained
strained for the rest of the day. So strained
and uncomfortable were they that Lucy,
wearied out by her hard work, was only too
glad to bid Ellen good night and seek her own
room early.</p>
<p>Through its windows long shafts of moonlight
fell across the floor, flecking it with
jagged, grotesque images of the trees outside.
Once alone, she did not immediately start to
undress, but lingered thoughtfully looking out
into the night. Every muscle in her body
ached, and in her heart was a sinking loneliness.
For the first time since her arrival at
Sefton Falls she surrendered herself to the distaste
she felt toward her aunt and her surroundings.
Could she stay, she asked herself.
The narrowness of the environment raised an
issue vital enough; nevertheless, grave as it
was, it sank into insignificance when weighed
against the vastly more potent factor of Ellen&#8217;s
personality. The girl had come east with the
intention of nursing and caring for her father&#8217;s
sister. She felt he would have wished her to
come; and casting every other inclination aside,
she had obeyed what seemed to her the voice of
duty. But she had been misled, disappointed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
None of her father&#8217;s kindliness lurked in this
embittered, malicious-matured woman, toward
whom, although bound by ties of blood, she felt
neither respect nor affection. Nor did her
aunt need her. After all, was it her duty to
remain and waste her youth to no purpose?
Could she face the horror of a stretch of years
that held in them no human sympathy? What
should she do? What ought she to do?
Should she go or stay?</p>
<p>As she lingered in the darkness, her weary
head heavy against the window frame, she
wrestled with the future and conscientiously
tried to reach some conclusion. She was eager
to do what was right. Had Ellen been sick or
feeble, as she had been led to suppose, she
would not have questioned leaving her, querulous
and tyrannical though she was. But this
woman was all-sufficient and needed no one.
Why should she bury her life in this cruel,
rancorous atmosphere? Would her own sweetness
survive the daily companionship of such
a person; rather, dominated by Ellen&#8217;s powerful
character, might she not become inoculated
by its poison and herself harden into a being as
merciless and self-centered? So deep was her
reverie that she did not hear the tap upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
door. A second afterward the knob turned
softly and her aunt entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t in bed?&#8221; she inquired in a high-pitched
whisper.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s lucky, I hoped you wouldn&#8217;t be.
Come in my room quick. I want you should
see what the Howes are doin&#8217;. They&#8217;re out
fussin&#8217; again over that thing they buried this
afternoon.&#8221; Ellen was obviously excited.</p>
<p>Sure enough! From the window that looked
toward the Howe farm, three figures could be
seen in the silvery light, grouped together beneath
the old linden. They were armed, as
before, with shovels, and all of them were digging.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look as if they were filling in
the hole,&#8221; Lucy remarked, interested in spite of
herself. &#8220;They seem to be digging up what
they buried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I thought,&#8221; responded
Ellen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they are shoveling the dirt out again,&#8221;
declared the girl.</p>
<p>For quite a while the two stood watching the
frenzied movements of their neighbors.</p>
<p>Then Ellen gave a cry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>&#8220;See! See!&#8221; she ejaculated. &#8220;They&#8217;re
histin&#8217; the bag out. Did you ever see such
doin&#8217;s? I&#8217;d give my soul to know what they&#8217;re
up to. Nothin&#8217; good, you may be sure of that&mdash;or
they wouldn&#8217;t take the dead of night to
do it. There, they&#8217;ve got the thing out now,
and two of &#8217;em are tugging it off between &#8217;em.
The other one&#8217;s fillin&#8217; in the hole and trampin&#8217;
down the earth. Seem&#8217;s if I&#8217;d simply have to
go over there an&#8217; find out what it&#8217;s all about!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy smiled at her aunt&#8217;s exasperated tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you?&#8221; she asked mischievously.</p>
<p>Ellen gave a short laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only way the Howes will ever get me
on their land will be to chloroform me,&#8221; said
she grimly. &#8220;But I should like to know before
I go to bed what they&#8217;ve been doin&#8217;. I
s&#8217;pose it&#8217;s no use to set up any longer, though,
tryin&#8217; to figure it out. We&#8217;d both better go to
sleep. Good night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night,&#8221; Lucy returned.</p>
<p>Only too glad to escape, she hurried back to
her own room, slipped out of her clothes, and
was soon lost in heavy, dreamless slumber.</p>
<p>The day had been a strenuous one, and she
was very tired, so tired that she might not have
been awakened promptly had she not stirred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
in her sleep and become dimly conscious of a
flood of radiance upon her pillow. The morning
sunshine was brilliant in the chamber, and
standing in its circle of gold she beheld Ellen.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s six o&#8217;clock,&#8221; she announced breathlessly,
&#8220;an&#8217; I want you should get right up.
Martin Howe&#8217;s gone off to the village in his
wagon, an&#8217; I can&#8217;t help a-thinkin&#8217; that now he&#8217;s
out of the way them sisters of his will start
doin&#8217; somethin&#8217; more with that bag.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What bag?&#8221; yawned Lucy sleepily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the bag they were buryin&#8217; last
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly the girl&#8217;s latent faculties aroused
themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;You hurry up and dress while I go and
watch,&#8221; panted Ellen. &#8220;Be quick&#8217;s you can,
or we may miss somethin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went out, closing the door; but in a few
moments her niece heard her shrill call:</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re comin&#8217; out with it! What&#8217;d I tell
you? Two of &#8217;em have got it, carryin&#8217; it across
the lawn. Ain&#8217;t you &#8217;most dressed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fastening her belt as she went, Lucy hurried
to her aunt&#8217;s side.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>Amid the sparkling, dew-kissed glory of
early morning, she could plainly see the three
Howes making their way through the wet
grass in the direction of their pasture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless me! if they don&#8217;t mean to sink it in
the brook!&#8221; whispered Ellen. &#8220;Oh, I never
can stand this. I&#8217;ve got to foller &#8217;em an&#8217; find
out what they&#8217;re doin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t!&#8221; exclaimed Lucy in dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I would,&#8221; her aunt retorted. &#8220;I&#8217;d
go to any length to see what&#8217;s in that bag. If
they were younger&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she broke off
abruptly. &#8220;Anyhow, it&#8217;s somethin&#8217; they&#8217;re
ashamed of, I&#8217;m certain of that. They couldn&#8217;t
&#8217;a&#8217; murdered anybody, I s&#8217;pose. Bad&#8217;s I hate
&#8217;em, I&#8217;d hardly think they&#8217;re that wicked. Still
what can it be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to track &#8217;em down, anyhow,&#8221;
Ellen announced. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t you comin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>To spy on the actions of others did not appeal
to the younger woman&#8217;s honest mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can get breakfast while I&#8217;m gone
then,&#8221; Ellen said, catching up her coat, &#8220;and
if I don&#8217;t come back pretty soon, you go ahead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
and eat yours. I&#8217;d a thousand times rather
ferret out what those Howes are tryin&#8217; to
bury than eat. I&#8217;d be willin&#8217; to starve to do
it.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE UNRAVELING OF THE MYSTERY</h3>
</div>

<p>LEFT to herself Lucy stood for an instant
watching her aunt&#8217;s resolute figure make its
way under the fringe of lilacs that bordered the
driveway. Then she turned her attention to
preparing breakfast, and the Howes and their
mysterious doings were forgotten.</p>
<p>In the meantime Ellen walked on, skirting
the shelter of the hedge until she came into the
lee of a clump of elder bushes growing along
the margin of the brook at the juncture of the
Howe and Webster land. Here she secreted
herself and waited.</p>
<p>The brook was quite deep at this point and
now, swollen by the snows that had recently
melted on the hillsides, purled its path down to
the valley in a series of cascades that rippled,
foamed, and tinkled merrily.</p>
<p>As she stood concealed beside it, its laughter
so outrivaled every other sound that she had
difficulty in discerning the Howes&#8217; approaching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
tread, and it was not until the distinct
crackle of underbrush reached her ear that she
became aware they were approaching. She
peered through the bushes.</p>
<p>Yes, there they were, all three of them; and
there, firm in their grasp, was the mysterious
bag.</p>
<p>It was not large, but apparently it was
heavy, and they handled it with extreme
care.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s put it down,&#8221; puffed Mary, who was
flushed and heated, &#8220;an&#8217; look for a good deep
place. Ain&#8217;t you tired, &#8217;Liza?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t so tired as hot,&#8221; Eliza answered.
&#8220;Warn&#8217;t it just providential Martin took it
into his head to go to the village this mornin&#8217;?
I can&#8217;t but think of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the luckiest thing I ever knew,&#8221; assented
Mary. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217;
done with this thing round the house another
day. I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; gone clean out of my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I still can&#8217;t understand why we couldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217;
left it buried,&#8221; Eliza fretted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I explained why to you last night,&#8221; Jane
answered, speaking for the first time. &#8220;There
warn&#8217;t a spot on the place that Martin might
not go to diggin&#8217; or plowin&#8217; up sometime. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
might even &#8217;a&#8217; dug round the roots of the linden
for somethin&#8217;. Ain&#8217;t he always fertilizin&#8217; an&#8217;
irrigatin&#8217;? I didn&#8217;t dare leave the bag there.
If he&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; gone stickin&#8217; a pick or a shovel into
it sudden&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; interrupted Eliza. &#8220;&#8217;Twas stupid
of me not to understand before. &#8217;Course that
wouldn&#8217;t do. Yes, I guess you were right.
There ain&#8217;t much to do but sink it in the brook.
Would you &#8217;a&#8217; dreamed there could be anything
in the world so hard to get rid of? All
I&#8217;ve got to say is I hope neither Martin nor old
Miss Webster finds it. What do you s&#8217;pose
they&#8217;d say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want Martin to come on to it
unexpected. &#8217;Twould worry me to death.&#8221;
Eliza shuddered.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t care about old Miss Webster,&#8221;
Jane observed with a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never wished Miss Webster ill, goodness
knows that,&#8221; returned Eliza gravely. &#8220;None
of us ever did &#8217;cept Martin, an&#8217; he&#8217;s got no
business to. I s&#8217;pose he&#8217;d like nothin&#8217; better
than to have her run across this thing. You
don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose there&#8217;s any danger that she will,
do you, Jane?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Danger of her findin&#8217; it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No. I mean danger of her gettin&#8217; hurt
with it,&#8221; explained Eliza timidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy, no. How could it harm her if it
was wet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno,&#8221; whimpered Eliza. &#8220;I&#8217;m so
scat of such things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s certainly made us trouble
enough!&#8221; put in Mary, with a sigh. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
felt like a criminal ever since the thing came to
light. It&#8217;s seemed as if we&#8217;d never get rid
of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane smiled. &#8220;I know it,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Who&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; believed &#8217;twould be so hard. When
I think what we&#8217;ve been through tryin&#8217; to make
way with it, I wonder folks ever are wicked.
It&#8217;s so much trouble. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t half as easy as
it looks. You&#8217;ve got to have your wits about
you every second. This affair&#8217;s taught me
that. Ain&#8217;t I been all over the face of the
earth tryin&#8217; to find a safe place to hide this
pesky bag! First I tried the mountain. Then
I was afraid the woodcutters might find it, so
I had to cart it home again. Then it come to
me to drive down to the river and dump it in.
Anybody&#8217;d have said that was simple enough.
But halfway there, I met Elias Barnes walkin&#8217;
to the village, an&#8217; he asked for a ride. I s&#8217;pose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
he couldn&#8217;t see why I couldn&#8217;t take him in; I
had an empty seat an&#8217; had often done it before,
so I had to. But when he started lightin&#8217; up
his pipe&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you do, Jane?&#8221; cried Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I nearly screamed,&#8221; answered
Jane, laughing. &#8220;He looked some surprised;
anyhow, I told him I just remembered somethin&#8217;
I&#8217;d left behind, an&#8217; I drew up an&#8217; put him
down quicker&#8217;n chain lightnin&#8217;. Then I
turned round and drove off lickety-split for
home, leaving him stock still in the middle of
the road starin&#8217; after me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You showed good nerve, Jane, I&#8217;ll say
that,&#8221; Mary declared with open admiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now if it had been me, I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; just given
the whole thing away. I ain&#8217;t no good at
thinkin&#8217; quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we ain&#8217;t got to think about it any
more, thank goodness,&#8221; Jane exclaimed, rising
from the grass and laying a hand on the bag.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s put an end to the whole thing now and
go home. Take a holt of the other end, and
we&#8217;ll flop it in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; Eliza protested, seized by a sudden
idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose there&#8217;ll be any danger
&#8217;bout the cows drinkin&#8217; here, do you?&#8221; Eliza
inquired anxiously. &#8220;They do drink here,
you know, and in the summer, when the water&#8217;s
low, they often wade right in. If they was
to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought of that,&#8221; Jane said in a
discouraged tone. &#8220;Oh, my land, what are
we going to do with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>She let the bag sink to the ground and,
straightening herself up, confronted her sisters.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve simply got to get it off our
hands before Martin gets back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, yes!&#8221; pleaded Mary, affrighted.
&#8220;Do something with it, Jane, no matter what.
I never could stand it to have it carted back to
the house and hidden there. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t safe.
Besides, in these days of German spies, &#8217;twould
be an awful thing to be found on us. S&#8217;pose
the house was to be searched. We never could
make the police believe how we came to have it.
They might take us and shut us all up in prison&mdash;Martin
and all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice shook with terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess they wouldn&#8217;t go arrestin&#8217; us,
Mary,&#8221; declared Jane soothingly. &#8220;Still, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
agree with you that it&#8217;s just as well for us to
be clear of such a thing; let me think.&#8221;</p>
<p>While she stood meditating her two sisters
watched her with perturbed faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ellen Webster&#8217;s cows don&#8217;t come up to
this end of the pasture much, do they?&#8221; she
remarked at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Leastways I&#8217;ve never seen &#8217;em here,&#8221;
replied Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t we sink the bag just across
the wall?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On her land?&#8221; gasped Eliza.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t do any harm,&#8221; argued Jane.
&#8220;She never comes up here, nor her cows nor
horses either. We&#8217;ll climb right over and
dump the thing in. That&#8217;ll settle Martin&#8217;s
ever finding it, an&#8217; everythin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But s&#8217;pose&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Eliza objected once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, &#8217;Liza, we can&#8217;t stay here s&#8217;posin&#8217; all
day!&#8221; Jane declared decisively. &#8220;We got to
put this bag somewheres, an&#8217; there ain&#8217;t any
spot that ain&#8217;t got some out about it. We
must take a chance on the best one we can
find.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m frightened to death!&#8221; wailed Eliza.</p>
<p>&#8220;So&#8217;m I!&#8221; Mary echoed. &#8220;Oh, Jane!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter. Pull yourself together,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
ordered Jane sharply. &#8220;You two take a hold of
the bag an&#8217; bring it along, while I climb the
wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen, stooping behind the elderberry bushes,
held her breath. She saw Jane clamber over
the barrier and help Mary and Eliza to mount
it and lower the sack into her hands; then, just
when the three invaders were all ready to drop
their mysterious gray burden into the stream,
she stepped noiselessly into the open and said
loudly:</p>
<p>&#8220;What you doin&#8217; in my brook?&#8221;</p>
<p>A cry rose from the two more timorous
Howes, and even Jane paled a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you sinkin&#8217; in my brook?&#8221; repeated
Ellen.</p>
<p>No answer came. Angered by their silence,
the woman stepped nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you got in that bag?&#8221; she demanded
sternly.</p>
<p>Still there was no reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t got nothin&#8217; good in it, I&#8217;ll be
bound,&#8221; went on the tormentor. &#8220;If you had,
you wouldn&#8217;t be so mighty anxious to get rid
of it. Come now, long&#8217;s you&#8217;re intendin&#8217; to
heave it into the water on my side of the wall,
s&#8217;pose you let me have a peep inside it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>Striding forward, she seized a corner of the
canvas roughly in her hand.</p>
<p>There was a scream from the three Howes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep away!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better leave it be, Miss Webster,&#8221;
Jane said in a warning voice. &#8220;It&#8217;s gunpowder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gunpowder!&#8221; repeated Ellen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; what, may I ask, are you doin&#8217; with a
bag of gunpowder in my brook? Plannin&#8217; to
blow up my cows, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! No, indeed we&#8217;re not!&#8221; protested
Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t hurt your cows for anything,
Miss Webster,&#8221; put in Eliza.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! You wouldn&#8217;t? Still you don&#8217;t
hesitate to dam my brook up with enough gunpowder
to blow all my cattle higher&#8217;n a kite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were only tryin&#8217; to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Mary;
but Jane swept her aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, Mary,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You an&#8217; &#8217;Liza
keep still an&#8217; let me do the talkin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Drawing herself to her full height she faced
Ellen&#8217;s evil smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;The day before yesterday, when we were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
cleanin&#8217; the attic, we found a little door under
the eaves that we&#8217;d never come across before,&#8221;
she began desperately. &#8220;We discovered it
when we were movin&#8217; out a big chest that&#8217;s always
stood there. We were sweepin&#8217; behind
all the trunks an&#8217; things, an&#8217; long&#8217;s we were,
we decided to sweep behind that. &#8217;Twas then
we spied the door. Of course we were curious
to know where it went to, an&#8217; so we pried it
open, an&#8217; inside we found this bag together
with an old rusty rifle. It must &#8217;a&#8217; been there
years, judgin&#8217; from the dust an&#8217; cobwebs collected
on it. We were pretty scared of the
gun,&#8221; declared Jane, smiling reminiscently,
&#8220;but we were scared a good sight worse when
after draggin&#8217; the bag out we saw &#8217;twas marked
<i>Gunpowder.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>She waited an instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t know what to do with it,&#8221; she
went on, speaking more hesitatingly, &#8220;because
you see my brother doesn&#8217;t like us to turn the
house upside-down with cleanin&#8217;; he hates
havin&#8217; things disturbed; an&#8217; we were afraid he
would be put out to find what we&#8217;d done. So
we decided to wait till some time when he
wasn&#8217;t round an&#8217; make way with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane caught her breath.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve tried lots of ways,&#8221; she confessed
wearily, &#8220;but none of &#8217;em seemed to work.
First I thought of hidin&#8217; it up near Pine Ridge,
but I was afraid some woodsman might happen
on it; then I started to take it down to the river
in our wagon; but Elias Barnes would get in
an&#8217; light his pipe, and I was so afraid a spark
from it might&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish it had!&#8221; interpolated Ellen Webster
with fervor.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to get rid of him I had to turn
round an&#8217; come back,&#8221; narrated Jane, paying
no heed to the interruption. &#8220;Then we tried
to bury it, but afterward we dug it up for fear
Martin might plow it up sometime an&#8217;
get&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twould &#8217;a&#8217; been an almighty good joke
if he had!&#8221; again piped Ellen.</p>
<p>&#8220;So there didn&#8217;t seem to be any other way,&#8221;
concluded Jane with dignity, &#8220;but to drop it in
the brook; an&#8217;, as you never seemed to use this
end of your pasture, we decided to sink it
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The narrative was true, every word of it.
Ellen knew that. No one who looked into
Jane Howe&#8217;s frank face could have doubted
the story.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>But Ellen was an ungenerous enemy who
saw in the present happening an opportunity
to put a screw upon those who had been thus
compelled to throw themselves upon her mercy.</p>
<p>&#8220;So! That&#8217;s how you lie out of it, is it?&#8221;
she cried scornfully. &#8220;An&#8217; you expect me to
believe a yarn like that! Do you s&#8217;pose I don&#8217;t
know this country&#8217;s at war, an&#8217; that the authorities
are on the lookout for folks concealin&#8217;
gunpowder in their houses? How do I know
you weren&#8217;t goin&#8217; to make the stuff into bombs,
or carry it somewheres an&#8217; blow up somethin&#8217;
or other with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, oh, indeed we weren&#8217;t,&#8221; Mary
cried, thoroughly alarmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what shall we do!&#8221; Eliza sobbed,
wringing her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; cut in Jane. &#8220;You know perfectly
well, Miss Webster, we ain&#8217;t no German
plotters. I&#8217;m sorry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sorry I caught you before you had
a chance to drop that bag in my brook,&#8221; said
Ellen, a twinkle in her eye. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you are.
Have you thought that I can have you arrested
for trespassing on my land?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jane!&#8221;</p>
<p>The horrified voices of Mary and Jane
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
greeted with concern this new danger. Ellen
was exulting in her triumph.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can, of course, have us arrested if you
wish to,&#8221; said Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to&mdash;at least I ain&#8217;t, on
one condition. An&#8217; I&#8217;ll promise not to give
you over to the police as spies, neither, if you
do as I say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want us to do?&#8221; inquired
Mary and Eliza breathlessly.</p>
<p>Jane was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe <i>you&#8217;d</i> like to know the condition,&#8221;
sneered the old woman, addressing Jane.</p>
<p>She waited for a reply, but none came.
Ellen looked baffled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better accept the chance I give you
to buy yourself off,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is my affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do, Jane! Do promise,&#8221; begged Mary
and Eliza. &#8220;Please do, for our sakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; Jane returned. &#8220;But I only
do it to protect my sisters. What is the condition?&#8221;</p>
<p>With head thrown back she faced Ellen
coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The condition is that you take that bag of
gunpowder back home to your brother Martin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
an&#8217; tell him Ellen Webster sent it to him with
her compliments. He can use it blastin&#8217; out
stones to fix up his stone wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, with a taunting laugh, the woman
turned and without more adieu disappeared in
the direction of the Webster homestead, leaving
a speechless trio of chagrined Howes behind
her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>WHEN THE CAT&#8217;S AWAY</h3>
</div>

<p>May came and went, and June, rich in days
of splendor, made its advent, and still Lucy
caught only fleeting glimpses of the Howes.</p>
<p>Martin, to be sure, was daily abroad, toiling
with the zest of an Amazon in garden and hay-field.
Against the homely background of
stubble or brown earth, his sturdy form stood
out with the beauty of a Millet painting. But
his sisters held themselves aloof, avoiding all
possibility of contact with their neighbors.</p>
<p>Doubtless the encounter with Ellen had left
its scar; for against their will they had been
compelled to take up the sack of powder and
tug it homeward; and then, in compliance with
their promise, deliver it over to Martin who
had first ridiculed their adventure; then berated
them; and in the end set the explosive off so
near the Webster border line that its defiant
boom had rattled every pane of glass in the
old house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>Ellen had chuckled at this spirited climax
to the episode. It was like Martin, she said.
But Lucy regretted the whole affair and found
difficulty in applauding her aunt&#8217;s dramatic
imitation of the affrighted Howes and their
final ignominious retreat. Of course it was
only to be expected that the women next door
should resent the incident and that they should
include her, innocent though she was, in this
resentment. Nevertheless, it was a pity that
the avenue to further friendly advances between
herself and them should be so summarily
closed.</p>
<p>Lucy was very lonely. Having been the
center of a large and noisy household and received
a disproportionate degree of homage
from her father&#8217;s employees, the transition
from sovereign to slave was overwhelming.
She did not, however, rebel at the labor her
new environment entailed, but she did chafe
beneath its slavery. Nevertheless, her captivity,
much as it irked her, was of only trivial
importance when compared with the greater
evil of being completely isolated from all sympathetic
companionship. Between herself and
her aunt there existed such an utter lack of
unity of principle that the chasm thereby
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
created was one which she saw with despair it
would never be possible to bridge. Had the
gulf been merely one of tastes and inclinations,
it would not have been so hopeless. But to
realize they had no standards in common and
that the only tie that bound them together was
the frail thread of kinship was a disheartening
outlook indeed.</p>
<p>It was true that as time went on this link
strengthened, for Ellen developed a brusque
liking for her niece, even a shamefaced and unacknowledged
respect. Notwithstanding this,
however, the fundamentals that guided the actions
of the two remained as divergent as before,
and beyond discussions concerning garden
and home, a few anecdotes relating to the
past, and a crisp and not too delicate jest when
the elder woman was in the humor, their intercourse
glanced merely along the shallows.</p>
<p>Over and over, when alone, Lucy asked herself
why she stayed on at Sefton Falls to sacrifice
her life on the altar of family loyalty.
Was not her youth being spent to glorify an
empty fetish which brought to no one any real
good?</p>
<p>But the query always brought her back to
the facts of her aunt&#8217;s friendlessness and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
infirmity. For defy Time as she would, Ellen
was old and was rapidly becoming older.
Whether with the arrival of a younger and
more energetic person she was voluntarily relinquishing
her hold on her customary tasks,
or whether a sudden collapse of her vitality
forced her to do so, Lucy could not determine;
nevertheless, it was perfectly apparent that
she daily attacked her duties more laggingly
and complained less loudly when things were
left undone.</p>
<p>When, however, Lucy tried to supplement
her diminishing strength by offers of aid, Ellen
was quick to resent the imputation that she was
any less robust than she had been in the past,
and in consequence the girl confronted the delicate
problem of trying to help without appearing
to do so.</p>
<p>Parallel with this lessening of physical zeal
ran an exaggerated nervous irritability very
hard to bear. Beneath the lash of her aunt&#8217;s
cruel tongue Lucy often writhed, quivered,
and sometimes wept; but she struggled to keep
her hold on her patience. Ellen was old, she
told herself, and the self-centered life she had
led had embittered her. Moreover, she was
approaching the termination of her days, and to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
a nature like hers the realization that there was
no escape from her final surrender to Death
filled her with impotent rage. She had always
conquered; but now something loomed in her
path which it was futile and childish to seek to
defy.</p>
<p>Therefore, difficult as was Lucy&#8217;s present
existence, she put behind her all temptation to
desert this solitary woman and leave her to die
alone. Was not Ellen her father&#8217;s sister, and
would he not wish his daughter to be loyal to
the trust it had fallen to her to fulfill? Was
she not, as a Webster, in honor bound to do
so?</p>
<p>In the meantime, as if to intensify this sense
of family obligation, Lucy discovered that she
was acquiring a growing affection for the home
which for generations had been the property
of her ancestors. The substantial mansion,
with its colonial doorways surmounted by
spreading fans of glass, its multi-paned windows
and its great square chimney, must once
have breathed the very essence of hospitality,
and it did so still, even though closed blinds and
barred entrances combined to repress its original
spirit. Already the giant elm before the
door had for her a significance quite different
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
from that of any other tree; so, too, had the
valley with its shifting lights. She loved the
music of the brook, the rock-pierced pasture
land, the minarets of the spruces that crowned
the hills. The faintly definable mountains,
blue against the far-off sky, endeared themselves
to her heart, weakening her allegiance to
the barren country of her birth and binding
her to this other home by the magic of their
enchantment.</p>
<p>Here was the spot where her forefathers had
lived and toiled. Here were the orchards they
had planted, the fields they had tilled, the
streams they had fished, the hills they had
climbed; and here was the house built by their
hands, the chairs in which they had rested, the
beds in which they had slept. Her former
life had contained none of these elements of
permanence. On the contrary, much of the
time she had been a nomad, the mining settlements
that gave her shelter being frankly regarded
as temporary halting places to be abandoned
whenever their usefulness should become
exhausted.</p>
<p>But here, with the everlasting hills as a
foundation, was a home that had been and
should be. Tradition breathed from the very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
soil, and Lucy&#8217;s veneration for the past was
deep-rooted. Therefore, despite her aunt&#8217;s
acrimonious disposition, the opposition of their
ideals, despite drudgery and loneliness, she
stayed on, praying each day for increased
patience and struggling to magnify every trace
of virtue she could discover in Ellen.</p>
<p>Now that the planting was done, the weeding
well in hand, the house-cleaning finished, the
girl contrived to so systematize her work that
she should have intervals of leisure to escape
into the sunshine and, beneath the vastness of
the arching heaven, forget for the time being
at least all that was rasping and petty.</p>
<p>It was absurd to be lonely when on every
hand Nature&#8217;s voices spoke with understanding.
Was she joyous? The birds caroled,
the leaves danced, the brook sang. Was she
sad? The whisper of the great pines brought
peace and balm to her spirit.</p>
<p>It was in search of this sympathy that she
had set forth along the highway to-day. The
late afternoon was a poem of mystic clouds and
mysterious shadows. Far off against the distant
horizon, mountains veiled in mists lifted
majestic peaks into the air, their summits lost
amid swiftly traveling masses of whiteness;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
rifts of purple haze lengthened over the valley;
and the fields, dotted with haycocks, breathed
forth the perfume of drying grass.</p>
<p>As Lucy walked along she began singing
softly to herself. Her day&#8217;s work was done;
and her aunt, who had driven with Tony to
bring home a load of lumber from the sawmill,
would not return until late in the evening.
Six delicious hours were her own to be spent
in whatever manner her fancy pleased. It
was an unheard-of freedom. Never since she
had come to Sefton Falls had she known such
a long stretch of liberty. What wonder that
she swung along with feet scarce touching the
earth!</p>
<p>A redwing called from the bracken bordering
the brook, and the girl called back, trying
to mimic its glad note. She snatched a flower
from the roadside and tucked it in her hair; she
laughed audaciously into the golden face of the
sun. Her exuberance was mounting to ecstasy
when she rounded a curve and suddenly, without
warning, came face to face with Jane
Howe.</p>
<p>The woman was proceeding with extreme
care, carrying in either hand a large and well-heaped
pail of berries.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>Before Lucy thought, she stepped forward
and exclaimed impulsively:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do let me help you! They must be dreadfully
heavy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t so much that they&#8217;re heavy,&#8221; Jane
answered, smiling, &#8220;as that they&#8217;re full. I&#8217;m
afraid I&#8217;ll spill some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me one pail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really mean it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. I&#8217;d be glad to take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied Jane simply. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure
I&#8217;d be only too thankful if you would. After
trampin&#8217; miles to pick raspberries, you ain&#8217;t so
keen on losin&#8217; &#8217;em when you&#8217;re within sight of
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed you&#8217;re not,&#8221; Lucy assented. &#8220;These
are beauties. Where did you go for them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most up to the pine ridge you see yonder.
I took my lunch an&#8217; have been gone since
mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How I wish I could have gone with you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you have liked to?&#8221; queried Jane
incredulously. &#8220;Then I wish you might have.
It was just the sort of a day to walk. I don&#8217;t
s&#8217;pose, though, your aunt would have spared
you for an all-day picnic.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a hint of scorn in the words.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t often have time to go far from the
house,&#8221; replied Lucy gently, ignoring Miss
Howe&#8217;s challenge. &#8220;There is so much to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So there is,&#8221; agreed Jane hastily. &#8220;Certainly
we manage to keep busy all the time.
When it ain&#8217;t one thing, it&#8217;s another. There
never seems to be any end to it. But I did
steal off to-day. The berries were really an
excuse. Of course we can make &#8217;em into jam.
Still, what I really wanted was to get out in the
air.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve stolen off too,&#8221; said Lucy, with a smile.
&#8220;My aunt and Tony have gone over to the
Crossing for lumber and won&#8217;t be back until
dark, so I am having a holiday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane was silent a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t you come over and have tea
with us then?&#8221; she asked abruptly. &#8220;We&#8217;re
all alone, too. My brother&#8217;s gone to the
County Fair an&#8217; ain&#8217;t comin&#8217; back &#8217;til to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s eyes lighted with pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very kind,&#8221; she cried, a tremor of
happiness in her tone. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>They walked along, balancing their burden
of berries and chatting of garden, weather, and
housework.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>As they turned in at the Howe gate, Jane
motioned proudly toward three rows of flourishing
vines that were clambering up a network
of sustaining brush.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are our sweet peas,&#8221; she remarked.
&#8220;The first row is Mary&#8217;s; they&#8217;re white. Then
come Eliza&#8217;s&mdash;pink ones. Mine are purple.
Martin won&#8217;t plant his over here. He has &#8217;em
longside of the barn, an&#8217; they&#8217;re all colors
mixed together. We don&#8217;t like &#8217;em that way,
but he does. He&#8217;s awful fond of flowers, an&#8217;
he has great luck with &#8217;em, too. He seems to
have a great way with flowers. But he never
cuts one blossom he raises. Ain&#8217;t that queer?
He says he likes to see &#8217;em growin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were nearing the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon Mary an&#8217; &#8217;Liza will be surprised
enough to have me come bringin&#8217; you home,&#8221;
observed Jane a trifle consciously. &#8220;We ain&#8217;t
done much neighboring, have we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; returned Lucy quickly, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve
been sorry. It seems a pity we shouldn&#8217;t be
friends even if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she stopped, embarrassed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if your aunt an&#8217; Martin do act like
a pair of fools,&#8221; interrupted Jane. &#8220;Senseless,
ain&#8217;t it! Besides, it ain&#8217;t Christian livin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
at odds with people. I never did approve
of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;We imagined you were like that,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I told Mary an&#8217; &#8217;Liza so the day you come for
the eggs. &#8216;She ain&#8217;t like her aunt,&#8217; I says to
Mary, &#8216;not a mite; an&#8217; you can be pretty sure
she won&#8217;t be in sympathy with all this squabblin&#8217;
an&#8217; back-bitin&#8217;.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We ain&#8217;t either, not one of us. We&#8217;d like
nothin&#8217; better&#8217;n to be neighborly an&#8217; run in.
It&#8217;s the only decent way of doin&#8217; when folks
live side by side. But Martin wouldn&#8217;t listen
to our doin&#8217; it, even if your aunt would&mdash;which
I know she wouldn&#8217;t. He&#8217;s awful set
against the Websters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How silly it seems!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I tell him,&#8221; Jane declared.
&#8220;Of course your aunt&#8217;s an old woman, an&#8217;
&#8217;tain&#8217;t surprisin&#8217; she should harbor a grudge
against us. But Martin&#8217;s younger, an&#8217; had
oughter be more forgivin&#8217;. It&#8217;s nonsensical
feelin&#8217; you&#8217;ve got to be just as sour an&#8217; crabbed
as your grandfather was. I don&#8217;t humor him
in it&mdash;at least not more&#8217;n I have to to keep the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
peace. But Mary an&#8217; &#8217;Liza hang on to every
word Martin utters. If he was to say blue was
green, they&#8217;d say so too. They&#8217;d no more do
a thing he wouldn&#8217;t like &#8217;em to than they&#8217;d cut
off their heads. They wouldn&#8217;t dare. I &#8217;spect
they&#8217;ll have a spasm when they see you come
walkin&#8217; in to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I ought not to come,&#8221; Lucy murmured
in a disappointed voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you ought,&#8221; Jane said with decision.
&#8220;Why should we keep up a quarrel none of us
approve of? Martin ain&#8217;t home. It&#8217;s nothin&#8217;
to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you&#8217;re sure you want me,&#8221; Lucy
laughed and dimpled.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t wanted you, you may be pretty
sure I shouldn&#8217;t have asked you,&#8221; retorted Jane
bluntly. &#8220;Mary an&#8217; &#8217;Liza will likely be scat
to death at first, but they&#8217;ll get over it an&#8217;
thaw out. Don&#8217;t pay no attention to &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane had ascended the steps and her hand
was on the latch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like a child playing truant,&#8221; said
Lucy, a flush of excitement tinting her cheek.
&#8220;You see, my aunt wouldn&#8217;t like my being
here any more than Mar&mdash;than your brother
would.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What they don&#8217;t know won&#8217;t hurt &#8217;em,&#8221;
was Jane&#8217;s brief answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I shall tell Aunt Ellen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t tell Martin. He&#8217;d rage somethin&#8217;
awful.&#8221;</p>
<p>She threw open the door. Lucy saw her
stiffen with resolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;I picked up Miss Lucy Webster on the
road an&#8217; brought her home to tea!&#8221; she called
from the threshold.</p>
<p>Mary and Eliza were busy at the kitchen
table. At the words they turned and automatically
gasped the one phrase that always sprang
to their lips in every emergency:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jane!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin&#8217;s away an&#8217; so&#8217;s Ellen Webster,&#8221;
went on Jane recklessly. &#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t we
do a bit of neighborin&#8217; together, now we&#8217;ve got
the chance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but Martin!&#8221; Eliza managed to
stammer.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll never be the wiser&mdash;unless you tell
him,&#8221; replied Jane merrily. &#8220;Come, Miss
Lucy, take off your hat an&#8217; make yourself at
home. Supper&#8217;ll soon be ready, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>The phrase was a fortunate one, for it
brought back to the disconcerted Howes the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
memory of their domestic prowess, a thing in
which they took great pride. By nature they
were hospitable, and here was a chance to exercise
that long unexercised faculty.</p>
<p>Mary bustled to the stove.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;the biscuits are in
the oven, an&#8217; I was just makin&#8217; the tea.&#8221;
Then, as if emboldened by Jane&#8217;s attitude, she
added timidly: &#8220;We&#8217;re real glad to see you,
Miss Webster; don&#8217;t think we ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Eliza echoed, &#8220;we really are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first shock of the adventure having
passed, it was amazing to see with what
rapidity the Howe sisters increased the warmth
of their welcome. From the top shelf in the
pantry they brought forth the <i>company preserves</i>;
fruit cake was unearthed from the big
stone crock in the dining-room closet; and, as a
final touch to the feast, Jane beat up a foamy
omelet and a prune whip. In their enjoyment
they were like a group of children, an undercurrent
of delight in the forbidden tinging
their mirth.</p>
<p>Lucy told stories of her western life, and the
three women listened as if to the tales of Sir
John Mandeville. The hours passed, twilight
deepened, night fell, but the revelers heeded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
it not. What a sweet, wholesome evening it
was! And how kindly, Lucy thought, were
these simple souls whose feeling toward every
breathing creature was so benign and sympathetic.
Contrasted with the antagonistic atmosphere
of the Webster house, this home was
like paradise. It restored her faith in human
nature and in Sefton Falls. Every one in the
place was not, then, bitter and suspicious.
What a comfort to know it!</p>
<p>In the meantime Mary, having reached a
pitch of hilarity almost unprecedented, was
starting to tell a story when suddenly her face
stiffened and, turning white, she half rose from
her chair.</p>
<p>There was a scuffling of feet in the hall and
in another instant Martin Howe entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fair wasn&#8217;t worth my stayin&#8217; to,&#8221; he
explained from the doorsill, &#8220;so I came along
home to-night instead of waitin&#8217; till to-morrow.
Looks to me as if I was just in time for a snack
of supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Standing in the lamplight, his stern face
softened by a smile and a glow of good humor,
he was attractive to look upon. The firm
countenance was lined, it is true, but the lines
gave it strength and brought into harmony the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
clear eyes, resolute mouth, and well-molded
chin. He had a fine smooth forehead from
which his black hair, lightly sprinkled with
gray, was tossed aside in picturesque abandon.
Health and power spoke in every curve of the
lithe frame and in the boyish grace with which
he moved.</p>
<p>With his coming a hush fell upon the room.
Had a group of conspirators been unexpectedly
confronted with their own crimes, they
could not have been more abashed than were
the four women seated at the table.</p>
<p>Jane was the first to recover herself. In a
voice that trembled but did not falter she said
courageously:</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Lucy Webster&#8217;s havin&#8217; tea with us,
Martin.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an awkward pause.</p>
<p>Lucy, whose glance had dropped to the floor,
raised her eyes appealingly to the man&#8217;s face;
but she found in it no answering sympathy.
In the short interval it had changed from
geniality to a sternness almost incredible of belief.
It was hard now&mdash;merciless.</p>
<p>Perhaps, to do Martin justice, he could not
have spoken at that moment had he tried. This
creature, with her wealth of golden hair, her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
radiant eyes, flashed upon his vision with the
glory of a new star. She was a phenomenon
hitherto unknown. No matter what her name,
the simple fact of her presence would have put
to flight every other thought and left him
dumb. The proudly poised head, the rounded
white throat, the flushed cheek with its elusive
dimples, the tiny hands were all marvels unfamiliar
to Martin Howe.</p>
<p>Could this nymph, this dryad be a product
of the same planet that had given birth to
Mary, Eliza, and Jane?</p>
<p>With no attempt to conceal his artless
scrutiny, he looked, and before his ingenuous
wonder Lucy felt her pulse bound.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go home,&#8221; she said, struggling to
appear composed and ignoring the speechless
Martin as if he were in reality as many miles
away as she had supposed him. &#8220;I had no
idea it was so late. Good night and thank you
for my pleasant evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>None of the Howes attempted to stay her
departure, although Jane followed her with
feigned imperturbability to the door, remarking
by way of conversation:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s dretful dark outside, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy smiled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>To have escaped Martin Howe&#8217;s eyes, which
continued to rest upon her, she would have
plunged into a den of lions. The beating of
her heart, the burning of her cheek angered and
disconcerted her.</p>
<p>Jane unfastened the door. Then she started
back in consternation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;It&#8217;s rainin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rainin&#8217;?&#8221; Eliza exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, pourin&#8217;. It&#8217;s an awful shower.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; asserted Lucy, impatient
to be gone. &#8220;I never mind the
rain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But this is a regular downpour. You&#8217;ll
get wet to your skin,&#8221; Jane objected. &#8220;I
ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to let you go out in it in that thin
dress. Ain&#8217;t we got an umbrella somewheres,
&#8217;Liza?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno,&#8221; Eliza answered vaguely.</p>
<p>The sudden shower and the furious tossing
of the trees did not impress themselves on her
dull mind. Only one thought possessed her
brain,&mdash;the sinking dread of the moment when
Lucy should be gone and Martin would empty
the vials of his waiting wrath on all their heads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I don&#8217;t in the least need an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
umbrella,&#8221; Lucy protested. &#8220;I&#8217;ll run right along.
Please do not bother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get wet an&#8217; be sick,&#8221; Mary declared,
launching into the conversation at the
mention of possible chills and fevers.</p>
<p>Lucy laughed unsteadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I shan&#8217;t. Good night.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had crossed the veranda and was at the
brink of the flight of steps when heavy feet
came striding after her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait! I&#8217;m goin&#8217; with you,&#8221; said a tense
voice. It was Martin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much, but I really don&#8217;t
need anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217;,&#8221; repeated the man doggedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to,&#8221; Lucy returned
curtly, nettled into irritability.</p>
<p>&#8220;Likely not,&#8221; observed Martin with stolid
determination.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; fretted Lucy
angrily. &#8220;I&#8217;d much rather&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>It was like a child helplessly dashing itself
against a wall. Martin paid no attention to
her protests. With a lighted lantern in one
hand and an umbrella in his other, he set forth
with Lucy down the driveway.</p>
<p>Overhead the trees wrenched and creaked,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
and above the lashings of their branches the
rain could be heard beating with fury upon
the tossing foliage. Once in the blackness
Lucy stumbled and, following the instinct for
self-preservation, put out her hand and caught
Martin&#8217;s arm; then she drew her hand quickly
away. They proceeded in silence until they
reached the gate at the foot of the long Webster
driveway; then the man spoke:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t fur now,&#8221; he said, halting short.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you the umbrella.&#8221; He held it out
to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll get drenched.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you will,&#8221; insisted Lucy with spirit.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is matter. Besides, I can&#8217;t see my way
to the house without the lantern. It&#8217;s dark as
pitch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take &#8217;em both, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I shan&#8217;t,&#8221; replied the girl indignantly.
&#8220;And anyway, if I did, I couldn&#8217;t
carry the two in this wind. If I can&#8217;t have but
one, I&#8217;d rather have the lantern.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nonsense!&#8221; Martin returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;What use was there in my bringin&#8217; you home
if you get soaked now?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t see an inch before my face
without a light.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as you say, then. Here it is.&#8221; Holding
out the lantern, he took back the umbrella.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you certainly are not going to leave
me to go up that long avenue in the rain,&#8221; burst
out Lucy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said you didn&#8217;t mind rain,&#8221; retorted
the man ironically.</p>
<p>He stood immovable in the torrent, but the
lantern glow showed his face to be working
convulsively.</p>
<p>Lucy, who could not believe that in the present
emergency his stubbornness would persist,
waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t comin&#8217;,&#8221; he remarked half to himself
with dogged determination, as if he were
bolstering up some inward wavering of principle.
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t comin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The touch of her hand still vibrated upon
his arm, and he could feel the flutter of her
dress against his body.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t comin&#8217;,&#8221; he repeated between his
closed teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>With dignity, Lucy picked up her limp
skirts, preparatory to breasting the storm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
&#8220;I <i>can&#8217;t</i> go with you,&#8221; he suddenly burst
out. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see I can&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>A wailing cry from the wind seemed to echo
the pain in his voice. The girl did not answer.
Refusing both the light and shelter he offered
her, she stepped resolutely forth into the blackness
of the night. Helplessly he watched her
go, the lantern&#8217;s rays reflecting her white gown.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t bother you again, Mr. Howe,&#8221; she
called bitterly.</p>
<p>Martin made no reply but raised the lantern
higher that it might brighten the rough path.
Unheeding him, the girl stumbled through the
darkness, the rain beating down upon her.</p>
<p>As she neared the house a faint glow flickered
through the shrubbery, making it evident
that her aunt had already arrived home. Nervously
she mounted the porch and turned to look
behind her. At the foot of the drive stood
Martin, the lantern high in his hands.</p>
<p>Now that Lucy was safely within the shelter
of her own domain, her sense of humor overcame
her, and with an irresistible desire to torment
him, she called mischievously from her
vantage ground on the veranda:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you so much for bringing me home,
Mr. Howe. Can&#8217;t I persuade you to come in?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>There was a smothered exclamation of wrath
in the distance, and she saw a gleam of light
precipitate itself hastily into the road, where,
for a moment, it flashed along the tree trunks,
then disappeared.</p>
<p>Lucy laughed.</p>
<p>Ellen was in the kitchen when she entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where on earth have you been?&#8221; she demanded.
&#8220;I should &#8217;a&#8217; thought you might &#8217;a&#8217;
come back in time to start the fire up an&#8217; get
supper. It&#8217;s awful late. Was it Tony you
was talkin&#8217; to outside?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It warn&#8217;t?&#8221; she turned a hawklike glance
on her niece. &#8220;Who was it?&#8221; she asked inquisitively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Howe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Ho&mdash;&mdash; Not <i>Martin</i> Howe!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin Howe here&mdash;<i>on my land</i>! What
was he doin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t on your land,&#8221; Lucy said. &#8220;He
left me at the gate. He was seeing me home.
I&#8217;ve been there to supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>
<p>Never had the girl heard so many sensations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
crowded into one word. There was surprise,
unbelief, scorn, anger. But anger predominated.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; how long, pray tell me, have you been
goin&#8217; backwards an&#8217; forrads to the Howes, an&#8217;
consortin&#8217; with their brother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen looked at her niece as if, had she dared,
she would have torn her in pieces. &#8220;I s&#8217;pose
it never entered your head it was a mean advantage
for you to take when I was gone,&#8221;
she said shrilly. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; dared do
it if I&#8217;d been here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fearless response was infuriating to
Ellen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you one thing,&#8221; she shouted,
bringing her clenched hand down on the table
with such force that every dish rattled. &#8220;You
ain&#8217;t to repeat this night&#8217;s performance! If
you ain&#8217;t got pride enough not to go hob-nobbin&#8217;
with my enemies, I&#8217;ll forbid it for
good an&#8217; all&mdash;forbid it, do you hear? I ain&#8217;t
a-goin&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Something in the quiet dignity of the girl
before her arrested her tongue. Her eye
traveled over the white, rain-drenched figure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
Then the corners of her mouth twitched and
curved upward.</p>
<p>&#8220;So Martin Howe saw you home, did he?&#8221;
she observed sarcastically. &#8220;Much good his
comin&#8217; did! Had you tramped ten miles you
couldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; got much wetter. I guess he needs
some lessons in totin&#8217; ladies round same&#8217;s he
does in most everything else. I always said he
didn&#8217;t have no manners&mdash;the puppy!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>JANE MAKES A DISCOVERY</h3>
</div>

<p>Martin Howe moved home as if in a trance,
the voice of Lucy Webster ringing in his ears.
He recalled every glance, every smile, every
gesture of this enslaving creature, who, like a
meteorite, had shot across his firmament, rocking
its serenity with the shock of her presence.
How exquisite she was! How wonderful!
He had never realized there were women like
that. Was it to be marveled at that men pursued
such enchantresses to the borderland of
eternity? That they were spurred to deeds of
courage; abandoned home, friends, their sacred
honor; even tossed their lives away for such?</p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s advent seemed to mark a new era in
existence. All that went before was not; and
all that came after, apart from her, mattered
not. Only the vivid, throbbing present was of
consequence, and the intensity of it swept him
out of his balance with a force that was appalling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>He was not the Martin Howe of yesterday,
nor could he ever again be that happy, emotionless
being. Within him warred a tumult of
new sensations that seethed, flamed, maddened,
consumed. The fact that they were the fires
of a volcano that must forever smolder its
passion out did not at first impress his consciousness.
All that he knew was that Lucy
Webster was to him what no other woman had
ever been or could be; she was his ideal, his
mate, his other soul; the completing element
of his incomplete nature. The emptiness of
his life, of which he had hitherto been only
vaguely aware, now translated itself into the
concrete terms of heart, mind, and sex. He
had been struggling to make of himself a whole
when in truth he was but a half; to construct
from imperfect parts a unit; and not sensing
the hopelessness of the attempt, he had reaped
only failure and disappointment.</p>
<p>How blind he had been not to understand
that alone he could never hope to still loneliness,
heartache, and the stirrings of his physical
nature. He had lived a life in which no
one shared and with which no one sympathized.
His fostering instincts had lain dormant until
they had reverted to the receptivity of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
protected rather than serving their natural functions
and making of him a protector. All the
masculinity of his being had been dwarfed,
stifled. Now it awakened, clamoring to possess,
guard, cherish, worship.</p>
<p>What an amazing miracle it was&mdash;what a
glad, transforming touch of magic! He
laughed in delight! Years slipped from him,
and his youth surged up in all its warmth and
eagerness. Why, he was a boy again! A boy
at the threshold of life&#8217;s wonderland. He was
looking open-eyed into a garden of beauty
where his foot had never trod. Mystic realms
were there, mazes of fairy dreams, lights and
colors he had never seen. At last the place of
his desire was before him.</p>
<p>This other self, this woman, Lucy Webster,&mdash;the
name brought with it an arresting
chill that fell upon the fever of his passion with
the breath of a glacier. The girl was a Webster!
She was of the blood of those he scorned
and hated; of a kin with an ancestry he had
been brought up to loathe with all his soul.
Had he not been taught that it was his mission
to thwart and humble them? Had he not continually
striven to do so? He must have been
bewitched to have forgotten the fact for an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
instant. No doubt this creature with her rare
beauty was a decoy brought hither to tempt
him to betray his heritage.</p>
<p>Ellen Webster was quite capable of formulating
such a scheme and setting it in motion,
if only for the cruel pleasure of seeing him
ensnared in its toils. Perhaps even Lucy herself
was an accomplice in the plot. Who could
tell? To be sure she appeared artless enough;
but what Webster was to be trusted? And
were she only the innocent tool of a more designing
hand it redeemed her but little for,
blameless or guilty, she was nevertheless a
Webster. No power under heaven could wipe
out her inheritance; for the penalty of her
blood she must pay the price.</p>
<p>Ah, how near he had come to playing the
fool! Was it not Delilah who had shorn Samson
of his might? He, Martin Howe, to be
false to his traditions, forfeit his pride, and become
a spiritless weakling, forgetting his manhood
in the smile of a woman!</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; He cried the word aloud into the
teeth of the gale. To think he had almost
walked blindfolded into the trap Ellen Webster
had baited for him! Ah, she should see
he was not to be enticed away from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
stronghold of his principles by any such alluring
snare.</p>
<p>What a sly old schemer Ellen was! She
would have liked nothing better than to behold
him on his knees at the feet of this niece of hers
and then wreck his hopes by snatching away
every possibility of their fulfillment. Perhaps
she expected that with the girl&#8217;s beauty
as a bribe she could make him forget his dignity
to the extent of rebuilding the wall.</p>
<p>She was mistaken! He was not to be thus
cajoled. He had already, to some extent, betrayed
his vows that night by befriending
Lucy. Bitterly he repented of his weakness.
Doubtless at this very moment Ellen Webster
was exulting that he had so easily been duped
and hoodwinked.</p>
<p>Hot anger sent the blood to his cheek. He
had been blind to be thus caught off his guard.
Into what madness had this woman beguiled
him! Well, in the future the siren should
chant her Lorelei songs to deaf ears. Her
spell would be in vain.</p>
<p>He had found himself now. His wayward
feet had recovered their stand upon the solid
rock of principle, from which for the moment
they had been tempted into straying. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
would demonstrate to this Lucy Webster that
any friendliness between them was done and
over.</p>
<p>What an ass a clever woman could make of a
man! That any one could so circumvent him
was unbelievable. Shaking the rain viciously
from his umbrella, he mounted the steps, blew
out the lantern, and stalked into the house.</p>
<p>Mary, Eliza, and Jane looked up expectantly
as he entered. It was evident that a multitude
of questions trembled on their lips.</p>
<p>He hoped they would offer an apology or explanation
for their conduct and thereby furnish
him with the opportunity for berating
them and relieving his soul of the bitterness
that rankled there. To lash somebody, anybody,
with his tongue would have been a solace.</p>
<p>But although Jane faced him defiantly, and
Mary and Eliza with anticipatory timidity, no
one of the three spoke. They seemed to be
waiting for him to strike the first blow. Twice
he attempted it, assuming first an injured then
an outraged attitude. But on second thought,
he abandoned the attack. After all, what was
there to say? Should he rail at them for asking
Lucy to the house?</p>
<p>The fair face with its uplifted eyes came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
before his vision. No, he was not sorry the girl
had come. Though he must never see her
again, must never speak to her or touch her
hand, he was glad he had been vouchsafed this
one glimpse into Paradise.</p>
<p>He might forbid his sisters ever to have anything
more to do with her. But he could not
bring himself to do that either. And even
suppose he were to make the demand. Jane
might refuse to comply with it. There was
mutiny in her eyes, a mutiny he might not be
able to suppress unless he resorted to drastic
measures; and, smarting as he was from the
scorn and humiliation of his recent defeat, he
was in no mood to cut himself off from the only
sympathy within his reach by creating a breach
between himself and his sisters.</p>
<p>Therefore he loitered self-consciously before
the stove as if to dry his wet clothing and then
ambled across the room, remarking in offhand
fashion:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s settin&#8217; in for quite a rain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s a hard shower,&#8221; Mary ventured,
turning a puzzled glance upon her brother.
&#8220;We need it though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the ground was like chalk,&#8221; agreed
Martin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>Thrusting his hands into his trousers pockets,
he took a few nervous strides around the room
and, prompted by an impulse he could not have
explained, he stopped and absently drew down
the window shade on the side of the kitchen toward
the Webster homestead.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t get any supper after all, did
you, Martin?&#8221; Jane remarked presently.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you let me bring you a piece of
fruit cake an&#8217; a glass of milk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would taste kinder good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although he had no wish for the food, the
solicitude that accompanied the suggestion was
just then very soothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could cook you somethin&#8217;,&#8221; Jane said,
rising.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; broke out the man impatiently.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t go fussin&#8217;. I don&#8217;t want much. Just
get me anything you have handy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane went to the pantry and returned with
two thick slices of &#8220;war cake&#8221; and a tumbler
of creamy milk.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the sort of cake you liked so much
the other day,&#8221; she said, putting it upon the
table. &#8220;It&#8217;s somethin&#8217; amazin&#8217; how it keeps
moist. I s&#8217;pose it&#8217;s the apple sauce in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She watched him while he broke it listlessly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
into fragments. It was obvious that he was
not hungry.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re tired, Martin,&#8221; she murmured at
last, in a gentle tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I am a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The trip to the fair was a hard one, I&#8217;m
afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the man found comfort in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no; not particularly hard,&#8221; he answered
with gruff kindness, &#8220;but the train was
close an&#8217; dusty.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a quality in the tone that caused
Jane to ponder. Furtively she studied the
bowed head, the twitching fingers, the contracted
brow; nor did the jaded, disheartened
droop of the mouth escape her. She could not
recall ever having seen Martin like this before.</p>
<p>Something must be weighing on his mind,
something that had not been there when he had
left home in the morning and had not been
there when he returned. The shadow, whatever
it was, had fallen since, and she felt it
had some connection with the happenings of
the evening. This unprecedented forbearance
of his was a part of it. Of that she was sure.
What did it portend? Was he angry? Or
had Lucy Webster dropped some remark that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
had shown him the folly and uselessness of his
resentment? Jane would have given a great
deal to know just what had occurred on that
walk in the rain. Perhaps Lucy had openly
attacked Martin&#8217;s codes and forced a quarrel.
She was fearless enough to do so; or perhaps
she had simply reproached him and set him
thinking.</p>
<p>Well, it was useless to ask questions. Jane
knew her brother too well to presume to do
this. If he had come to his senses, so much the
better. It was not to be expected that he
would admit it. That was not his way. Any
change in his mental attitude would be quickly
apparent, however, in his actions, his deeds confessing
the faults his lips were too proud to
utter. She must await developments.</p>
<p>Hence when he rose, she offered him her
customary casual good night and listened to his
slow tread upon the stairs. That unelastic
step only served to further convince her that
something recent and deep-acting had taken
hold on the man and was tormenting him.</p>
<p>She was roused from her musings by Eliza&#8217;s
voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;What can be the matter with Martin?&#8221;
she said in a tense whisper. &#8220;He never said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
a word. Here I was shakin&#8217; in my shoes,
dreadin&#8217; every minute to have him launch out
in one of his tirades. You could &#8217;a&#8217; knocked
me over when he didn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s goin&#8217; to wait until to-morrow,&#8221;
Mary replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. He never waits,&#8221; Eliza declared.
&#8220;When he&#8217;s mad he lets fly while his temper is
up. You know that as well as I do. There&#8217;s
no coolin&#8217; off with him an&#8217; then warmin&#8217; up the
leavin&#8217;s of his rage the next mornin&#8217;. He believes
in servin&#8217; things hot an&#8217; fresh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never knew him to be so sort of cowed
down,&#8221; reflected Mary. &#8220;You don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose
he&#8217;s sick, do you, Jane?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary turned anxious eyes toward her sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; Jane retorted promptly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t go worryin&#8217;, Mary, an&#8217; start to brew
him some thoroughwort in the hope of havin&#8217;
him down with a fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t hope he&#8217;ll have a fever,&#8221; objected
Mary in an injured tone.</p>
<p>Jane laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you know you&#8217;d love to have Martin
sick so you could take care of him,&#8221; said Jane
provokingly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t deny it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane Howe!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you would. But he isn&#8217;t sick, Mary.
He&#8217;s just tired. I wouldn&#8217;t bother him about
it if I was you. He hates bein&#8217; fussed over.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sudden light of understanding had broken
in on Jane&#8217;s soul.</p>
<p>It came like a revelation, in an intuitive
flash, backed neither by evidence nor by logic.
Had she tried to give a reason for the astonishing
conviction that overwhelmed her, she could
not have done so. Nevertheless she was as
certain of it as she was that the night would
follow the day. Martin was neither hungry,
angry, tired, worried, nor ill.</p>
<p><i>He was in love!</i></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>A TEMPTATION</h3>
</div>

<p>Martin was indeed in love! Before a week
had passed no one knew it better than he.</p>
<p>During the solitary hours when his hands
were busy thinning lettuce or weeding young
corn, his mind had abundant leisure for reflection,
and the theme on which his thoughts
turned with increasing activity was always the
same. Defy Fate as he would, he faced the
realization that he loved Lucy Webster with
every fiber of his being.</p>
<p>It was a mad and hopeless affection,&mdash;one
which, for the sake of his own peace of mind if
for no other reason, it would be wiser to
strangle at its birth. Nevertheless, he did not
strangle it; on the contrary, he hugged the
romance to his breast and fed it upon all the
tender imaginings of a man&#8217;s first dream of
love, conjuring before his vision one empty
fantasy after another.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>It was evening, and under the silver light of
a thin crescent hanging low in the heaven he
paced beneath the trees, Lucy upon his arm.
Or lovely with the freshness of early morning,
she stood with him in the field, the brightness
of her eyes as sparkling as the flash of the dew-drops
on the grass. Again she came before
him, gliding quietly amid a maze of humble
domestic tasks, transforming each with the
grace of her presence. Or perhaps she sat
quietly watching the embers of a winter&#8217;s fire
that touched her hair to a glory of glinting
copper.</p>
<p>But wherever she moved, the land upon
which she trod was <i>his</i> land; the home where
she toiled <i>his</i> home; the hearth that warmed her
<i>his</i> hearth.</p>
<p>There were long hours when he was alone in
the twilight with only his pipe for company,
when through the smoke he seemed to see her
close beside him. Sometimes she smiled down
into his eyes; sometimes she raised her sweet
lips to his; and once she came to him with
madonna-like holiness, a sleeping child in her
arms,&mdash;her child&mdash;and his.</p>
<p>Then Martin would rouse himself to find his
pipe smoldering, the lamp dim, and the chill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
of the night upon him. With an impatient
shrug he would spring to his feet and tramp
upstairs, hoping to find in slumber an escape
from these fair but tormenting reveries.
Sleep, however, came but fitfully, and even
from the sacred confines of its privacy it was
impossible to banish subconscious mirages of
the day. There was no place to which he could
flee where thoughts of Lucy Webster did not
pursue him.</p>
<p>He saw her often now, very often, tripping
buoyantly from house to barn, from barn to
garden and back again, her round young arms
bearing baskets of vegetables, or laden with
shining milk pails.</p>
<p>How proud her head! How light her step!</p>
<p>One morning she skirted the wall so close
that his whisper might have reached her had
he chosen to speak. He could see the fringe
of dark lashes against her skin, the rise and fall
of her round bosom, the lilacs that filled her
hands. But he did not speak and neither did
she. In fact, she seemed not to see him, so
busy was she toying with her flowers. She
must be fond of flowers, for she was seldom
without one tucked in her gown.</p>
<p>These glimpses, however, were fleeting, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
after he had yielded to the temptation of indulging
in them he was wont to tax himself
severely for his folly. Was he not already
tortured with pain too poignant to be endured?
Why rivet more tightly the fetters
that goaded him?</p>
<p>He had fled once and for all from Circe&#8217;s
magic, vowing that never again should the
sorceress work her charm upon him; and that
vow he intended to keep. Nevertheless, it did
not prevent him from stealing an occasional
peep at the enchantress, if only to assure himself
that her spell was as potent and deadly as
he had supposed it. Surely, if he did not consort
with her, looking could do no harm.
Therefore he indulged his fancy, watching
Lucy whenever she was within sight and each
time becoming more helplessly entangled in
her fascinations, until any escape from the
thralldom of her beauty became impossible.
His days were a cycle of tantalizing visions
which ceased only with the coming of darkness;
and when with the night he would have found
release from their misery, it was only to discover
that night an endless stretch of hours
that intervened betwixt him and the moment
when the visions might return again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>Poor Martin! He endured a hell of suffering
during those radiant summer days. He
was melancholy, ecstatic, irritable by turns,
ascending to the heights and plunging into the
depths with an abruptness and unaccountability
that was not only enigmatic to himself but to
every one else with whom he came in contact.
He kept Mary in a ferment of excitement trying
to devise remedies for his successive ills.
One day she would be sure he needed a tonic to
dispel his listlessness and with infinite pains
would brew the necessary ingredients together;
but before the draught could be cooled and administered,
Martin had rebounded to an unheard-of
vitality. Ah, she would reason, it
must be his appetite that was at the bottom of
the trouble. She must stimulate his desire for
food. No sooner, however, was her concoction
of herbs simmering on the stove than her erratic
patient was devouring everything within sight
with the zest of a cannibal. So it went, the
affliction which oppressed him one day giving
place to a new collection of symptoms on the
morrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have Doctor Marsh to him if I had any
opinion of the man,&#8221; remarked Mary one night.
&#8220;But I ain&#8217;t ever been able to muster up my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
respect for that critter&#8217;s principles since he left
that medicine for &#8217;Liza marked <i>&#8216;Keep in a
Dark Place.&#8217;</i> That was enough to shake my
confidence in him forever. It was so under-handed.
I&#8217;d rather had &#8217;Liza sick for the rest
of her life than that she should &#8217;a&#8217; been dosed
up on some stuff we had to keep hidden away
lest somebody see it. If he was ashamed of
the medicine, or it was anything we&#8217;d hadn&#8217;t
ought to had, he shouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; given it to us. I
never said nothin&#8217; to nobody &#8217;bout it, but I
poured the whole bottleful down the sink, and
told Doctor Marsh that he needn&#8217;t come again.
He pretended he couldn&#8217;t see why, but I guess
he understood, an&#8217; I hope the lesson did him
good,&#8221; concluded Mary with righteous zeal.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that was the reason Doctor Marsh
stopped comin&#8217;!&#8221; Jane exclaimed. &#8220;I always
wondered. You never told me that before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mary with dignity, &#8220;I never
did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mary,&#8221;&mdash;Jane broke into a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t laugh, Jane. It was a very
serious matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d only explained it, Mary, I could
have told you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is precisely why I didn&#8217;t explain it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
Jane,&#8221; Mary answered. &#8220;I knew you would
interfere, an&#8217; I felt it was somethin&#8217; that laid
between me an&#8217; my conscience. No matter
what you&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; said, I should &#8217;a&#8217; felt the same
way about it. Matters of right an&#8217; wrong are
the affairs of me an&#8217; my Maker. Nobody else
on earth can settle &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were instances when it was useless to
argue with Mary, and Jane saw that this was
one of them.</p>
<p>Had she so willed she could not only have
cleared up the mystery about Doctor Marsh&#8217;s
medicine, but she could have furnished her sister
with the key to Martin&#8217;s caprices, and
thereby saved the metaphysician not only much
worry but also much physical labor.</p>
<p>Mary and Eliza, however, lived in such a
miniature world that Jane knew if Martin&#8217;s secret
were divulged it would become the unending
topic of conversation from that moment on.
Moreover, so intense would be his sisters&#8217; excitement
concerning the affair, and so keen
their interest and curiosity that they might
blunder into destroying the delicate fabric of
the romance altogether. Hence Jane kept her
own council, speculating with amusement as
to how long it would be before his two solicitous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
but blinded relatives should stumble upon the
truth.</p>
<p>In the meantime the neighboring between
the two families, so bravely begun, was not continued.
Mary and Eliza Howe had not the
courage or the initiative to attempt a second
clandestine tea-party, much as they would have
enjoyed it; and Jane saw no use in urging
Lucy to the house. If Martin decreed to further
the affair, he was quite capable of doing
so without any aid of hers; and if he ordained
to abandon it, as he evidently did, wild horses
could not turn him from his purpose. Therefore
Jane gave up all her aggressive attempts
to heal the breach between Howe and Webster,
and contented herself with waving to Lucy
over the wall and calling a cheery greeting to
the girl whenever she came within hailing distance.</p>
<p>Lucy was disappointed by this retreat of her
neighbors into their former aloofness. Of
course their action was traceable to Martin.
It was his fault. No doubt he had gone home
and berated his sisters for their friendliness and
had so intimidated them that they had no choice
but to bow to his will. Jane was the only one
of them anyway who had the spirit to defy her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
brother, and presumably she had decided that
the game was not worth the candle. Perhaps,
too, she was right. To live in a daily purgatory
made of life a sorry existence. She herself had
found that out.</p>
<p>Her aunt was continually becoming more
irritable and less sound of judgment, and there
were times when Lucy feared that the warped
mind would give way under the strain of repeated
paroxysms of anger. Could Ellen
have been persuaded to surrender the management
of her affairs entirely into her niece&#8217;s
hands, she might have been spared much annoyance;
but frail as she was, she persisted in
retaining to the last her scepter of supremacy.</p>
<p>She went each day into the garden and put
Tony out of humor by finding fault with
everything he did; having demoralized his
temper, she would return to the house to rasp
Lucy&#8217;s patience by heaping upon the girl&#8217;s
blameless head such remnants of wrath as she
still cherished toward the long-suffering
Portugese.</p>
<p>For sometime she had contented herself with
this daily programme, not varying it by venturing
away from the place, even to carry her
garden truck to market. Therefore Lucy was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
astounded when one morning her aunt appeared
at breakfast, dressed in her shabby
black cashmere and wearing her cameo pin,
and announced she was going to drive to
town.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve an errand to do,&#8221; she said without preamble,
&#8220;an&#8217; I shan&#8217;t be home till noon. You
needn&#8217;t go falutin&#8217; over to the Howes&#8217;, neither,
the minute my back is turned, as you did the
last time I went off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy smiled good-humoredly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to see a lawyer,&#8221; her aunt went
on. &#8220;Lawyer Benton.&#8221;</p>
<p>No reply appearing necessary, Lucy did not
speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; piped Ellen, after waiting a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what?&#8221; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you got no interest in what I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
for?&#8221; the woman demanded querulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always interested in anything you wish
to tell me,&#8221; answered the girl, &#8220;but I thought
it was not my place to inquire into your business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my business, an&#8217; I can keep it to myself,&#8221;
said Ellen tartly. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll tell you this
much&mdash;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to get my will made.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>The hard blue eyes fixed themselves on
Lucy&#8217;s face narrowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;My will!&#8221; repeated Ellen, a challenge in
her tone. &#8220;I s&#8217;pose you thought it was all
made long ago; but it warn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to
make it to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>At a loss how to reply, Lucy nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem much concerned &#8217;bout it,&#8221;
observed her aunt peevishly. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t you curious
to know who I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to leave my property
to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;S&#8217;pose I was to give it all to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be very kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it would be&mdash;it would be kind,&#8221; agreed
Ellen. &#8220;But mebbe I ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to. Mebbe
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to will it to somebody else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s your affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet, for all your indifference, you&#8217;d be
mad as a wet hen if I was to leave it to somebody
else,&#8221; went on the woman provokingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I shouldn&#8217;t. Why should I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause you&#8217;re my next of kin. By rights
it had oughter come to you, hadn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know the New Hampshire laws.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>With an admiring glance at her niece, Ellen
broke into an unpleasant laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no trappin&#8217; you, Miss Lucy Webster,
is there?&#8221; she exclaimed, rising from her
chair and clapping on her hat. &#8220;You&#8217;re a
cute one, an awful cute one!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t need to be told,&#8221; chuckled
Ellen. &#8220;Anybody as cute as you are, <i>knows.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>With that she was gone.</p>
<p>All the morning the girl busied herself
within doors, exchanging one duty for another.
Toward noon, however, she made an excursion
to the garden for lettuce and radishes. Her
pathway lay close to the wall, and on her return
to the house she was amazed to see lying
on the topmost stone of the ruined heap a mammoth
bunch of sweet peas. There was no mistaking
the fact that the flowers were intended
for her, for her name had been hastily scrawled
on a bit of crumpled paper and placed beside
them. Nothing could have surprised her more
than to stumble upon this offering.</p>
<p>Evidently the blossoms had just been gathered,
for the raindrops of the previous night
still sparkled among their petals, jeweling
with brilliancy their kaleidoscopic riot of color.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>She caught them up with delight, burying
her face in their cool fragrance. Where had
they come from? She knew no one who raised
sweet peas,&mdash;no one except the Howes, and of
course&mdash;&mdash;she halted and blushed. Could
it have been the Howes?</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Mary&#8217;s are white</i>&#8221; she heard herself automatically
repeating in Jane&#8217;s phrases. &#8220;<i>&#8217;Liza&#8217;s
pink, an&#8217; mine are purple. Martin has his in
another place, &#8217;cause he likes all the colors
mixed together. But he never picks his nor
lets us. He says he likes to see &#8217;em growin&#8217;.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>And now, by some miracle, here were the
blossoms of Martin&#8217;s raising, their prismatic
tints exquisite as a sunset. It was like holding
the rainbow in one&#8217;s hands. She knew the
Howes too well to cherish for an instant the
illusion that any of the three sisters had cut the
flowers from the vines. They would not have
dared. No. No hand but Martin&#8217;s had
plucked them.</p>
<p>With a strange fluttering of her heart, Lucy
carried the bouquet to her own room, a corner
of the house where Ellen seldom intruded.
There she bent over it with a happy, triumphant
little smile. Then, from behind the shelter of
the muslin curtain, she blew a kiss from her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
finger tips to Mr. Martin Howe, who was hoeing
potatoes on the hill, with his back set
squarely toward the Webster mansion.</p>
<p>When Ellen returned at noon, there was
still a shell-like flush of pink on the girl&#8217;s cheek
and on her lips a smile for which her aunt could
not account.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where you been?&#8221; inquired the woman
suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nowhere. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You look as if somebody&#8217;d sent you a
Christmas tree full of presents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy laughed softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t been to the Howes&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been anywhere,&#8221; repeated Lucy,
throwing up her chin. &#8220;I&#8217;m telling the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen eyed her shrewdly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I reckon you are,&#8221; she observed
slowly. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t never caught you lyin&#8217; yet.&#8221;
Then as if an afterthought had occurred to her,
she added: &#8220;Likely you&#8217;ve been thinkin&#8217;
&#8217;bout the will I&#8217;ve been makin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw Lucy open her lips, then close
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it all done,&#8221; went on Ellen
audaciously. &#8220;It&#8217;s drawn up, signed, an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
sealed. In fact, I brought it home with me.
Here it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tossing a large white envelope fastened with
a splash of red wax upon the table, she peered
at her niece.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to give it to you to keep,&#8221; continued
she in a hectoring tone. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be like
havin&#8217; Pandora&#8217;s box around. You can&#8217;t
open it, an&#8217; you&#8217;ll have the continual fun of
wonderin&#8217; what&#8217;s inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I want you to,&#8221; asserted Ellen. &#8220;I&#8217;m
givin&#8217; it to you to take care of. It&#8217;ll help to
make life interestin&#8217;. Besides, who knows but
you may be tempted to break it open some
night an&#8217; have a peep inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Craftily the old woman watched the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or mebbe you&#8217;ll tear it up,&#8221; she mused.
&#8220;Who knows? Then if I was to die, you could
pretend I hadn&#8217;t made no will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it back. I shan&#8217;t keep it,&#8221; Lucy
cried, moving toward the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid of yourself, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>The monosyllable rang with scorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then prove it,&#8221; sneered Ellen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it to me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>Smiling evilly, her aunt pushed the packet
across the table. There was a leer of triumph
in the sharp-featured face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;magine that &#8217;twas gettin&#8217; as mad as you
are now that kep&#8217; the Websters from ever
buildin&#8217; up that wall,&#8221; she called after her
niece, as Lucy with crimson cheeks fled up the
stairs, the long white envelope in her hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I want you should go to the village to-day,&#8221;
announced Ellen, making her appearance
in Lucy&#8217;s room on a hot August morning
a few weeks later. &#8220;Tony&#8217;s got to get the
scythe mended an&#8217; have Dolly shod. Don&#8217;t it
beat all how somethin&#8217;s always wearin&#8217; out?
Long&#8217;s he&#8217;s goin&#8217;, you might&#8217;s well drive along
with him an&#8217; take the eggs an&#8217; corn I promised
Elias Barnes. There&#8217;s some more errands at
the store I want done, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Aunt Ellen.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the woman loitered.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t want to hang &#8217;round town till
Tony gets ready to come back, mebbe you
could find somebody comin&#8217; this way who would
give you a lift home. It seems sort of a shame
to stay there wastin&#8217; the time you could be
usin&#8217; here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy smiled at the characteristic remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; if you didn&#8217;t happen on any one,&#8221; went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
on Ellen, &#8220;likely you wouldn&#8217;t mind walkin&#8217;;
&#8217;twould get you home quicker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed. I always like a walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon &#8217;twill be warm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen was always gracious when her plans
went to her satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to be ready to start right after
breakfast,&#8221; she added, as she went out the door.
&#8220;The earlier you get off the earlier you&#8217;ll be
back again. I wish I could go myself an&#8217;
dicker with Elias. I would if it warn&#8217;t that I
have to tinker with that pesky cream separator.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the cream separator out of order?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ellen wearily. &#8220;Trust that
Tony to bust everythin&#8217; he touches.&#8221;</p>
<p>She closed Lucy&#8217;s door with a spirited bang.</p>
<p>The girl listened to her retreating footsteps
and smiled softly. It was nothing new for
Ellen to be sending her to the village to transact
the business she no longer felt able to attend
to herself, but the subterfuges to which
she resorted to conceal her real motive were
amusing. Lucy knew well that to-day, if it
had not been the cream separator, something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
else equally important would have furnished
the excuse for keeping her aunt at home. It
seemed so foolish not to be honest about the
matter. To pursue any other method, however,
would have been quite foreign to Ellen&#8217;s
policy, and therefore Lucy, although not
blinded by these devices to hide the truth, always
pretended she was, and earnestly condoned
with the old woman about the rebellious
potato sprayer, the obstinate pump, or whatever
other offending object chanced to be
selected as the plea for casting her cares on
younger shoulders.</p>
<p>The trip to the village was tiresome; of that
there was no doubt,&mdash;especially on a day that
promised to be as hot as this one. Already
tremors of heat vibrated upward in waves from
the piazza roof, and the sun&#8217;s scorching rays
pierced between the closed blinds. Nevertheless,
Lucy did not regret the prospect of the
morning&#8217;s excursion. She so seldom had an
opportunity to leave the house that any break
in the monotony of her days, uncomfortable
though it might be, was a welcome diversion.</p>
<p>Therefore she hurried her dressing and
breakfast, and while dawn was still on the
threshold, set off with Tony in the dust-covered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
surrey that creaked its way along behind the
stumbling gray mare.</p>
<p>The coolness of night was over the awakening
earth, although the mounting sun was
speedily drinking up the dew and rousing the
locusts into droning song. Not a leaf stirred.
Through the shimmering atmosphere the valley,
with its river yellow as a band of molten
gold, lay listless in drowsy haze; but the birds,
butterflies, and bees flitted among the flowers
that bordered the roadside with an alertness
which proved that they, at least, felt no lessening
of zest for their honey gathering.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be an almighty hot day,&#8221; observed
Tony who, after slapping Dolly&#8217;s broad
back several times with the reins, had decided
that further attempts to accelerate the mare&#8217;s
pace was useless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, very hot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope your aunt won&#8217;t go pullin&#8217; that
separator all to pieces while we&#8217;re gone,&#8221; the
boy grumbled. &#8220;In the first place she ain&#8217;t
got a notion of how to put it together again;
an&#8217; in the next place she ain&#8217;t fit to go liftin&#8217;
an&#8217; haulin&#8217; things about the way she does.
She&#8217;s gettin&#8217; to be an old woman. Ain&#8217;t she
most eighty?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not far from it,&#8221; answered Lucy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if I was her age an&#8217; had her money,
you wouldn&#8217;t see me workin&#8217; as if a slave driver
was standin&#8217; over me,&#8221; the Portuguese lad declared.
&#8220;What good is it doin&#8217; her bein&#8217; rich,
I&#8217;d like to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t think she is rich,&#8221; said Lucy
quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Folks say she is; that&#8217;s all I know &#8217;bout it,&#8221;
replied Tony. &#8220;Elias Barnes was calculatin&#8217;
one day down to the store that she must be
worth thousands. I can believe it, too,&#8221; added
the boy significantly. &#8220;Everything we&#8217;ve got
on the farm is tied up with string, or hitched
together with a scrap of wire. Your aunt
ain&#8217;t fur gettin&#8217; a thing mended long&#8217;s it can
be made to hold together. &#8217;Bout everything
on the farm wants overhaulin&#8217;. I&#8217;d give a fortune
to see a smart man come in here an&#8217; set
the place to rights. There&#8217;s a lot of truck in
the barn oughter be heaved out an&#8217; burned.
&#8217;Tain&#8217;t fit for nothin&#8217;. But Miss Webster
would no more hear to partin&#8217; with one stick
nor stone she owned than she&#8217;d cut off her
head. She&#8217;d keep everything that belonged to
her if it was dropping to bits.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy paused.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s one good thing,&#8221; he added,
smiling, &#8220;she can&#8217;t take the stuff she&#8217;s hoarded
with her into the next world, an&#8217; when it falls
to you you can do as you like with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Falls to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes. &#8217;Course all your aunt&#8217;s property&#8217;ll
be yours some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think so?&#8221; Lucy asked,
a suggestion of reserve in her tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who else is there to have it?&#8221; inquired
Tony, opening his eyes very wide. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t she
already left it to you in her will?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy laughed at his incredulousness.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they say down to the town that your
aunt made her will &#8217;bout three weeks ago.
Even Lawyer Benton himself admitted that
much. Folks saw Miss Webster goin&#8217; into his
office an&#8217; questioned him. He warn&#8217;t for
tellin&#8217; anything &#8217;til they nagged at him; then
he did own that the farm an&#8217; everything else
was left to <i>relatives</i>. Elias Barnes an&#8217; some
of the others were mighty quick to hunt up
who the Webster relatives were. They were
pretty sure you were the only one, an&#8217; it &#8217;pears
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
you are. So it&#8217;s you will get the place an&#8217; the
money, an&#8217; goodness knows, Miss Lucy, you&#8217;ve
earnt it. The men all agreed to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, Tony, Miss Webster is my
aunt,&#8221; began Lucy in a warning voice, loyalty
resenting this criticism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but there&#8217;s aunts&mdash;an&#8217; aunts,&#8221; interrupted
the lad with a grin. &#8220;It&#8217;s no use pretendin&#8217;
you ain&#8217;t drawn the devil of a one,
&#8217;cause I know. Don&#8217;t I live close at hand, an&#8217;
ain&#8217;t I got eyes?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy did not answer. They were nearing
the village and to put an end to the conversation,
she took out her list of errands and began
to read it absently. But in the back of her
mind she was turning over Tony&#8217;s remarks.
She had never allowed herself to dwell on the
time when the Webster homestead would
actually be her own. It seemed unfitting to
plan on acquiring property that could only
come to her through the death of another person.
Now, however, she suddenly gave her
imagination rein and began to consider what
changes she would make when the farm was
really in her hands.</p>
<p>The barn must be cleared out the first thing
and be re-shingled. Then she would strip the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
farm of its litter of rubbish and repair some of
the tools and household furniture. What a delight
it would be to renovate the old home with
chintz hangings and fresh paint and paper!
There were great possibilities for making the
interior of the house attractive on a small expenditure
of money. The time-worn mahogany
was good, the proportions of the rooms
pleasing, and the great fireplaces, several of
which were now boarded up, were a distinct
asset.</p>
<p>Of course she would have to have help with
the work. It would be well to get a capable
man to manage the garden for her&mdash;some
strong, intelligent person, familiar with the
problems of soil, fertilizer, and horticulture; a
person, for example, like, well&mdash;like Martin
Howe. A flood of color crept into her cheek.</p>
<p>Although she had never addressed a remark
to Martin since the night when he had abandoned
her at the foot of the Howe driveway to
face the onslaughts of that drenching storm,
she was perfectly aware that her goings and
comings had become a matter of no little concern
to the austere gentleman who dwelt on the
other side of the wall. That he watched her
she knew, for she had been feminine enough to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
trap him into changing his position that he
might keep her in view.</p>
<p>Besides, was there not the miraculous bunch
of flowers? She had, to be sure, never
acknowledged them even by the lifting of an
eyelash, nor had she proof that Martin&#8217;s hand
had really put them within her reach; nevertheless,
she could have staked her oath upon it.</p>
<p>Once she had almost defied his silence by
thanking him; in fact, she had actually ventured
to the confines of the Webster land with this
intention; but on arriving within range of his
presence, her courage had deserted her. He
looked so forbidding that a foolish agitation
had swept over her, and compelled her to drop
her eyes, and walk away in silence.</p>
<p>She had never known herself to be so nervous
before. One would almost think she was
afraid of Martin Howe. How absurd! He
was nothing to her, less than nothing.</p>
<p>If she liked to study his fine, athletic figure
and the free swing of his magnificent body
as he worked, it was solely from an æsthetic
standpoint. One seldom had an opportunity
to see a man as perfectly molded as he. His
face was interesting, too; not handsome, perhaps,
but attractive. It was a pity it was so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
stern and set, for she was sure he could smile
if he chose; indeed he had smiled that night
when he had come home and been unconscious
of her presence in the house. It had been a
compelling smile, charming for its very rareness.
She had often thought of it since and
wished she might behold it again. Of course
she never would. Yet it would be pleasant to
do so. Probably he smiled often at home,&mdash;even
laughed sometimes. How she would like
to hear him laugh,&mdash;just once.</p>
<p>He was a very fascinating person,&mdash;purely
as a character study, of course, nothing more.
Since, however, she was indulging in speculations
concerning him, it would be amusing to
know what he thought of her; for he did think
of her, that was obvious. What motive
prompted him to do it? Perhaps he admired
her, thought her pretty. If he did, why didn&#8217;t
he make some further effort to talk with her?
Usually men were only too eager to improve
the acquaintance of girls they liked. It surely
could do Mr. Martin Howe no harm to call a
good morning to her over the wall, as his sisters
did, even if he did deplore the existence of the
Websters.</p>
<p>Then the tenor of Lucy&#8217;s arguments shifted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
Probably Martin neither admired nor liked
her. Doubtless, along with her aunt and all
that pertained to the hated blood, he despised
her and simply watched her in disgust. But
if so, why did he bother to send flowers to her?</p>
<p>Lucy shook her head. She was back at the
point from which she had started and was no
nearer a solution of Martin Howe and his
baffling mental outlook. What did it matter
anyway? What he thought or felt was no concern
of hers, and she was silly to burden her
mind with speculations that really interested
her so little.</p>
<p>By this time Tony, who had lapsed into a
silence as unbroken as her own, drew up at the
smooth stone flagging before Elias Barnes&#8217;s
store and, leaping out over the wheel, helped
his companion to dismount from the wagon
and unload the farm produce they had brought
with them for sale.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get home somehow, Tony,&#8221; the girl said
to him, as he prepared to drive off. &#8220;You
needn&#8217;t come for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Miss Lucy, only I do hope you
won&#8217;t have to foot it back in this heat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a terrible day,&#8221; insisted the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
lad. &#8220;Them buzzin&#8217; locusts is enough to prove
that. They&#8217;re good as a thermometer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me,&#8221; she remarked
kindly. &#8220;Just as soon as I finish my errands
I shall start home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d be wise to.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the mare scuffed off down the road, amid
a cloud of dust, Lucy entered the store.</p>
<p>A stuffy odor of coffee, molasses, and calico
greeted her; so, too, did Elias Barnes, who
came forward from behind the counter, extending
his damp and sticky palm and showing
every tooth that an expansive smile permitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s you, Miss Lucy,&#8221; he observed with
pleasure. &#8220;I was expecting to see your aunt.
She was here the other day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she drove to town last Friday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Came on an interestin&#8217; errand, too,&#8221;
chirped Elias. &#8220;Leastwise, I &#8217;magine &#8217;twas
interestin&#8217; to you.&#8221; He grinned slyly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; repeated the man, taken aback.
&#8220;Because&mdash;well, ain&#8217;t such things always interestin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What things?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elias stared, uncertain as to how to proceed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>Was it possible the girl was ignorant of her
aunt&#8217;s mission?</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe you didn&#8217;t know Miss Webster&#8217;s
errand in town,&#8221; he began eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know she went to see Mr. Benton
and get her will made, if that is what you
mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; don&#8217;t you call that interestin&#8217;?&#8221; demanded
the discomfited Elias.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not particularly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The storekeeper gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Likely the matter was all cut an&#8217; dried an&#8217;
nothin&#8217; new to you,&#8221; persisted he, with a wan,
disappointed smile. &#8220;There warn&#8217;t much
choice left your aunt, fur as relatives went, was
there? Still, I reckon she couldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; found a
better one to pass her property on to than
you,&#8221; concluded the man with a leer.</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you so sure she has passed it
on to me?&#8221; inquired Lucy, annoyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, ain&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t&mdash;by thunder! She ain&#8217;t told
you nothin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elias looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he said, &#8220;most folks thought that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
was the condition that brought you to Sefton
Falls. Surely nothin&#8217; but some sort of a reward,
an&#8217; a big one, too, would coax a body to
come an&#8217; live with such a&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget you are speaking of my aunt,
Mr. Barnes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I did forget it a mite, Miss Lucy,&#8221;
mumbled Elias awkwardly. &#8220;I beg your
pardon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl inclined her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose we leave personal matters now
and settle our business,&#8221; she answered, motioning
toward the boxes, baskets, and egg cases
Tony had set inside the shop door. &#8220;Here is
the corn and the butter my aunt promised you,
and here are twelve dozen eggs. If you will
pay me for them, I will start back home before
it grows any warmer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lemme see,&#8221; ruminated Elias, &#8220;eggs is
bringing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seventy cents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it sixty-nine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I seem to have sixty-nine fixed awful firm
in my head,&#8221; protested Elias tenaciously.</p>
<p>Lucy laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to get it out then,&#8221; she retorted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
good-humoredly, &#8220;for seventy cents is the
market price.&#8221;</p>
<p>The firm answer told the shopkeeper that
further bickering would be useless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seventy cents then,&#8221; he said reluctantly,
opening his cash drawer. &#8220;It&#8217;s robbery,
though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not often robbed, Mr. Barnes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t I? Well, if I ain&#8217;t, it&#8217;s &#8217;cause folks
know better than to try to do me. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t
often I&#8217;m beat in a bargain&mdash;only when I&#8217;m
dealin&#8217; with a pretty woman an&#8217; give her the
advantage.&#8221; Again he displayed his rows of
teeth. &#8220;Ladies first is my motto; an&#8217; heiresses&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t paid me for the corn or butter
yet,&#8221; cut in Lucy impatiently. &#8220;Five dozen
ears of early corn and ten pounds of print
butter.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a second time Elias took from an infinitesimal
crack in his money drawer another
handful of change which he grudgingly
counted into the girl&#8217;s extended hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;There you are!&#8221; he asserted, as if wiping
some disagreeable thought triumphantly from
his memory. &#8220;Now we&#8217;re square an&#8217; can talk
of somethin&#8217; else.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t stop to talk to-day, Mr.
Barnes, for I&#8217;ve got to get home. Good-by
and thank you,&#8221; and with a smile that dazzled
the confounded storekeeper, Lucy sped out the
door.</p>
<p>Elias, who was a widower and &#8220;well-to-do,&#8221;
was considered the catch of the town and was
therefore unaccustomed to receiving such scant
appreciation of his advances.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be buttered!&#8221; he declared, chagrined.
&#8220;If she ain&#8217;t gone!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy was indeed far down the level road,
laughing to herself as she thought of the
discomfited Elias. This was not the first
time he had shown an inclination to force
his oily pleasantries upon her; but it was
the first time she had so pointedly snubbed
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it will do him good,&#8221; she murmured
half aloud. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to convince him
that every woman in Sefton Falls isn&#8217;t his for
the asking.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she went on her way between the bordering
tangle of goldenrod and scarlet-tinted
sumach, she was still smiling quietly. The sun
had risen higher, and a dry heat rose in waves
from the earth. Already her shoes were white,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
and moist tendrils of hair curled about her
brow. Before her loomed three miles of
parching highway as barren of shade as the
woodsman&#8217;s axe could make it. The picture
of Ellen&#8217;s cool kitchen and breezy porch made
the distance at that moment seem interminable.
There was not a wagon in sight, and unless one
came along, she would have to trudge every
step of the way home.</p>
<p>Well, there was no use in becoming discouraged
at the outset of her journey, and she was
not, although she did halt a moment to draw
a crisp, white handkerchief from her pocket
and fan her burning cheeks. She had no idea
the walk was going to be so hot a one. Despite
her aunt&#8217;s objections, she almost wished she
had waited for Tony. If only she could have
the good luck to be overtaken by somebody!
Hark, did she hear wheels?</p>
<p>Yes, as good fortune would have it, from
around the curve in the road behind her a
wagon was coming into sight, the measured
<i>clop, clop</i> of the horse&#8217;s feet reaching her distinctly.
The cloud of dust that enveloped the
approaching Jehu made it impossible for her
to see who he was; nevertheless, it did not much
matter, for country etiquette stipulated that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
those traveling on foot were always welcome to
the hospitality of a passing vehicle.</p>
<p>Therefore Lucy sat down on the wall to
await her oncoming rescuer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the wagon came nearer.</p>
<p>It contained a single occupant who was
perched with careless grace astride a barrel of
flour and appeared to be very much hedged in
by a multifarious assortment of small packages
and sacks of grain. It did not look as if
there were room in the carriage for an additional
ounce, and when the girl saw how
crowded it was, her heart sank; then as she
looked again, it bounded with sudden emotion,
for the man who so jauntily urged forward his
steed from his pinnacle on the barrel was none
other than Martin Howe.</p>
<p>Resolutely Lucy rose from the wall and,
without a glance in the traveler&#8217;s direction, set
out at a sharp pace along the highway.</p>
<p>She would not ask a favor of Martin Howe
if she had to plod every step of the three
scorching miles; and if he were brute enough to
let her toil along in the heat&mdash;to walk while he
rode&mdash;well, that was all she ever wanted to
know about him. Her heart beat tumultuously
as she heard the wheels coming closer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>The horse was beside her now, and the whirl-wind
of dust his hoofs raised made her choke.
Would the wagon stop or go on? The horse&#8217;s
head passed abreast of her, then his white,
lathered body. Next the wagon came into
sight, with Martin sitting proudly and stiffly
on his perch. Afterward horse, wagon, and
man rolled past, and the girl was left
alone.</p>
<p>Her lip trembled. Would he really leave
her like this in the dust and heat? Would he
leave even his worst enemy? It was incredible
a human being could be so heartless. And the
humiliation of it! To tag along behind him on
foot, smothering in his dust!</p>
<p>Rage possessed her. That should be the
end of Mr. Martin Howe! He was no gentleman.
He was not even human.</p>
<p>She sat down on the stone wall once more,
waiting for him to disappear and the dust from
his wheels settle.</p>
<p>But to her surprise she saw him come to a
stop in the road and, pivoting around on his
perch, face her.</p>
<p>Lucy did not move. She watched him hesitate,
waver, then dismount and come back
through the dust.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re on your way home&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began
with clumsy gravity.</p>
<p>The girl smiled up into his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re goin&#8217; back&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he repeated,
and again got no further.</p>
<p>She came to his rescue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you room to take me in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t much room.&#8221; She saw the
flicker of a smile shadow his face. &#8220;Still, if
you don&#8217;t mind bein&#8217; a mite cramped&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind it at all unless it crowds you
too much,&#8221; answered Lucy. &#8220;It is very kind
of you.&#8221; Then she heard herself add without
forethought: &#8220;I was afraid you were goin&#8217; by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t that much of a heathen, I hope,&#8221;
Martin returned gruffly.</p>
<p>Although it was plain he was ill at ease, he
helped her into the wagon, arranging the bags
of meal solicitously that she might be as comfortable
as possible. Then he touched the
horse with his whip, and they started off.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so thankful to have a ride home,&#8221;
sighed Lucy, after waiting a second or two and
finding he had no intention of speaking. &#8220;It
is very hot to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So &#8217;tis. But it is great weather for
corn.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; assented the girl. &#8220;How is
yours coming on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty well. Some blasted crow got a little
of it at the beginnin&#8217;; but the rest of it is all
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a shame you lost any of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a good deal put out myself. Still,
&#8217;twarn&#8217;t much, considerin&#8217; the size of the field.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy dimpled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your field is a wonderful sight from our
house,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;especially when the
wind blows. You have a fine lot of oats, too.
I love to watch the breeze sweep across it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do myself,&#8221; agreed Martin with increasing
cordiality. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty picture. There&#8217;s
lots of pretty pictures on a farm if you&#8217;re
lookin&#8217; for &#8217;em,&#8221; he added, stealing a glance at
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your sweet peas were a pretty picture,&#8221;
ventured Lucy mischievously.</p>
<p>Martin colored with confusion. He seemed
at a loss how to reply. Then, gathering courage,
he remarked shyly:</p>
<p>&#8220;You like flowers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love them!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some folks do,&#8221; said he hurriedly. &#8220;I
prefer to see &#8217;em growin&#8217;.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yet you do cut them sometimes,&#8221; persisted
Lucy playfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mighty seldom. Only when it&#8217;s good for
the vines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the glint of a smile brightened his
countenance, and she saw him blush sheepishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish it would be good for them again
sometime,&#8221; said she, peeping up into his eyes.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think there&#8217;s danger of their goin&#8217;
to seed?&#8221;</p>
<p>She heard a short laugh, but he did not answer.
Instead, as if to change a dangerous
topic, he asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you likin&#8217; Sefton Falls?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I think the place is beautiful. Already
I have become very fond of it. You
must love every stick and stone within sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was one while I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Martin
drawled slowly. &#8220;But afterward, when I saw
&#8217;twas my duty to stay here, I got to feelin&#8217; different.
I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; liked to have gone to the war.
I was too old, though; besides, I had my sisters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; murmured Lucy with quiet sympathy.
&#8220;You see, I had to make my choice,
too. My aunt wrote that she needed me. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
wouldn&#8217;t have been right for me to desert her
and go to France to nurse other people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s because of her you&#8217;re stayin&#8217; here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin did not speak again for some time;
then he said in a tense, uneven voice that struggled
to be casual:</p>
<p>&#8220;If she was to die then, I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;d start
back West where you came from.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&mdash;not&mdash;sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waited as if expecting her to explain herself,
and presently she did so.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might decide to make my home here,&#8221; she
went on. &#8220;That is, if I could get some one to
help me with the farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no intimation of coquetry in the
remark; merely simple fact. But the words
wrought a miracle in the face of the man beside
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like it that much?&#8221; he demanded
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Webster has a fine place,&#8221; ventured
Martin at length.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both of them are fine old places.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;But yours has been kept up better than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
ours,&#8221; continued Lucy. &#8220;You see, Aunt
Ellen isn&#8217;t strong like a man; and besides, she
hasn&#8217;t studied into new ways of doing things
as you have. That&#8217;s the interesting part of
farming, I think, to use your brains and make
two things grow where only one grew before.
If I were a man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She broke off, embarrassed by her own girlish
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you do?&#8221; inquired Martin
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d do with our farm what you&#8217;ve done
with yours. I&#8217;d get new tools, and I&#8217;d find
out how to use them. It would be fascinating.
But a woman can&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She can read just the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t a man&#8217;s strength,&#8221; returned
Lucy, shaking her head gravely. &#8220;It&#8217;s such
a pity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words slipped from his lips before it was
possible for him to recover them. He flushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Lucy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s as well for you to stay as you
were made,&#8221; he explained in a strangely gentle
voice.</p>
<p>The girl turned her head away. They had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
reached the foot of the Webster driveway, and
unbidden the horse halted. But as Lucy prepared
to climb out of the wagon, the man
stayed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon there&#8217;s some place I could turn
round, ain&#8217;t there, if I was to drive in?&#8221; he said
recklessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s plenty of room,&#8221; Lucy answered,
&#8220;only hadn&#8217;t you better drop me
here? My&mdash;my&mdash;aunt is at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; Martin retorted with the
same abandon. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to have you
plod up that long driveway in the broilin&#8217; sun&mdash;aunt
or no aunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed boyishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awfully good of you. But please, if
you mind coming, don&#8217;t; for indeed I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t your aunt,&#8221; asserted Martin
with a shy glance into her face.</p>
<p>Lucy met the glance with a blush and a
whimsical smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not,&#8221; she responded, &#8220;and sometimes
I wish you weren&#8217;t your father and your
grandfather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because if you were just <i>you</i>, you&#8217;d be
more forgiving&mdash;I know you would.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>She saw him bite his lips and a dull red tinge
his cheek. Without answering he turned into
the long avenue and presently drew up before
the side door.</p>
<p>&#8220;There you are!&#8221; he remarked stiffly.</p>
<p>Lucy did not need to look at him to sense
that the kindliness had left his countenance,
and his jaw had become grim and set.</p>
<p>Had she been able to read his thoughts, she
would have realized that the short detour into
Ellen Webster&#8217;s territory had brought Martin
to himself, and that he was already deploring
with inward scorn the weakness that had led
him to do the thing he had pledged his word
never to do. He could not even shunt off the
blame for his act and say, as did his illustrious
ancestor: &#8220;The woman tempted me and I did
eat.&#8221; No, he had open-eyed stalked voluntarily
into temptation,&mdash;willingly, gladly, triumphantly.
He had sinned against his conscience,
his traditions, his forbears, and behold, angry
as he was with himself for yielding to it, the sin
was sweet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE TEST</h3>
</div>

<p>Martin had guided his horse round the triangle
of sweet-williams and, still torn by conflicting
emotions of ecstasy and self-reproach,
was proceeding down the driveway when a cry
of distress reached his ear:</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin&mdash;Mr. Howe!&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to see Lucy Webster beckoning
frantically to him from the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back, please,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Hurry!&#8221;</p>
<p>That she was excited was evident. Indeed
she must have been quite out of her mind to
have called him Martin in that shameless fashion.
The fact that the name had slipped so
spontaneously from her lips and that she hastened
to correct her mistake caused the man to
speculate with delight as to whether she was
wont to think of him by this familiar cognomen.
This thought, however, was of minor
importance, the flash of an instant. What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
chiefly disturbed Martin was the girl&#8217;s agitation.</p>
<p>Bringing his horse to a stop, he sped back to
where she was standing, and on reaching her
side he was startled to see that the face but a
short interval before so radiant had blanched to
a deathly pallor.</p>
<p>&#8220;My aunt!&#8221; she whispered in a frightened
tone. &#8220;Something terrible has happened to
her!&#8221;</p>
<p>If Lucy entertained any doubts as to
whether he would aid her in the present
emergency she had either cast them aside or
was determined to ignore such a possibility,
for she held the door open with the obvious expectation
that he would follow her into the
house.</p>
<p>A year ago, a month, nay&mdash;a week, he would
never have consented to cross the Webster
threshold, let alone offer any assistance to its
mistress; but the siren who beckoned him on
had cast such a potent spell over his will that
now without open protest, although with a certain
inward compunction, he followed her
through the hall into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Upon the floor was stretched Ellen Webster&mdash;crumpled,
helpless, inert&mdash;her eyes closed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
and her stern face set as in a death mask. How
long she had lain there it was impossible to tell.
If she had called for succor it had been to
empty walls.</p>
<p>As with mingled sensations Martin stood
looking down upon her unconscious form,
Lucy threw herself upon her knees beside the
woman and gently touched her wrists and
heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t dead,&#8221; she murmured presently.
&#8220;She must either have had a fall or some sort
of shock. We must get her upstairs and send
for a doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;<i>we</i>&#8221; told Martin that the girl had not
even considered the chance of his refusing to
come to her assistance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tony is in the village,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;and
I don&#8217;t know what I should have done but for
you. How fortunate that you were here!&#8221;</p>
<p>Was it fortunate? Martin asked himself.</p>
<p>At last the moment for which he had longed
and prayed had come,&mdash;the moment when the
fate of his enemy lay in his hands, and it was
within his power to grant or deny succor.
There had never been a question in his mind
what he would do should this opportunity arise.
Had he not declared over and over again that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
Ellen Webster might die before he would lift
a finger to help her? He had meant it too.
All the bitterness of his soul had gone into the
vow. And now here he was confronted by the
very emergency he had craved from Fortune.
The woman he hated was at his mercy. What
should he do? Should he stand stanchly by his
word and let her life go out into the Beyond
when he might perhaps stay its flight? Or
should he weakly repudiate his word and call
her from the borderland to continue to taunt
and torment him? If a doctor were not summoned
quickly she might die, and her death be
upon his soul. Did he wish to stain himself
with this crime,&mdash;for crime it would be. Was
the revenge worth the hours of self-condemnation
that might follow? Who was he that he
should judge Ellen Webster and cut off her
life before its time? Vengeance is mine: I will
repay, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>The phrase rang insistently in Martin&#8217;s ears.
He tried to stifle it&mdash;ignore it&mdash;but still the assertion
continued to repeat itself within his
consciousness. Suppose, tempted by his
weaker nature and the appealing eyes of Lucy,
he were to yield to his better self and adopt a
merciful attitude, might not Ellen be restored
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
to health and jeer at him to the end of his days
for his magnanimity? Hers was not the creed
&#8220;If thine enemy hunger.&#8221; She would call
him coward and accuse him of a feeble, intimidated
will. Were the case to be reversed, she
would never curb her hatred to prolong his existence;
of that he was certain. He could see
her now bending over him, her thumb turned
down with the majestic fearlessness of a Cæsar.
She would term her act justice, and she would
carry out the sentence without a tremor.</p>
<p>But now that the same chance had come to
him, and he saw the old woman stretched before
him, her thin white hair snowy against the
wooden flooring, a vague pity stirred in his
heart. Death must come to us all sometime;
but how tragic to have its approach unheralded,
granting not an instant in which to raise
a prayer to Heaven. No, he could not let his
worst foe go down to the grave thus. He was
the captain of his own soul, but not of Ellen
Webster&#8217;s.</p>
<p>He glanced up to find Lucy&#8217;s gaze fixed
upon him. There was horror and anguish in
her eyes, and he realized that she had read
aright the temptation that assailed him. She
did not speak, she seemed scarcely to breathe:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
but the pleading face told him that should he
yield to his darker passions and show no pity,
she would forever loathe him for his cruelty.
Plainly as he saw this, however, it was not
to her silent entreaty that he surrendered.
Something deeper than love was calling
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Though I speak with the tongues of men
and of angels and have not charity&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
How persistently the sentences came to him!
They seemed to echo from out his memory&mdash;in
his mother&#8217;s voice&mdash;the voice of a vanished
past. She had taught him the words when he
was a boy, and he had not thought of them
since. Why did they now surge into his mind
to weaken his resolve and cause him to waver
in his intention? He wished he could get away
from Lucy&#8217;s eyes and the sight of the woman
upon the floor. Had his mother lived, she
might sometime have been as frail as this and
had hair as white. A sob broke from him, and
he stooped over his fallen foe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you want I should carry
her?&#8221; he asked, raising the limp body in his
arms.</p>
<p>Lucy did not answer at once, and when she
did her reply was unsteady.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The room is at the head of the stairs,&#8221; she
said, struggling to speak in her customary
tone. &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;d better go first.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hushed intimacy of the tragedy suddenly
brought the man and the woman very
close together.</p>
<p>She led the way and he followed with his
helpless burden. The form he bore was not
heavy. In fact, it was so fragile that it seemed
impossible that it could harbor so much venom
and hatred.</p>
<p>Ellen Webster was, after all, nothing but an
old, old woman. Perhaps, he reflected, in a
wave of regret, he should have realized this and
made allowance for it. Then a reaction from
his tense emotion swept over him, and he
thought with amusement how angry she would
be should she suddenly regain consciousness
and find herself within his grasp.</p>
<p>But she did not come to herself, and when he
laid her on the bed that Lucy had prepared,
she was still as unmindful of his touch as she
would have been had the spirit within her really
taken flight.</p>
<p>Martin did not linger now. His decision
was made.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll step over home an&#8217; get the other horse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
an&#8217; team, an&#8217; fetch the doctor back,&#8221; he said
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not thank him, accepting the favor
with the simplicity of a weaker nature that
leans unabashed on a stronger. Her dependence
and her confession of it thrilled him with
pleasure. She heard him creep cautiously
down over the stairs and go out at the side
door.</p>
<p>Then she turned her attention to making
more comfortable the helpless woman upon the
bed. When at length there was nothing more
she could do, she sat down to wait the doctor&#8217;s
coming. The time dragged on. It seemed
an eternity before help came.</p>
<p>In the meantime Ellen lay immovable as she
had done from the first, her hard, sharp-cut
features harder and more sharply defined in
their pallor than the girl had realized them to
be. In the furrowed brow, the deep-set eyes,
the pitiless mouth there was not one gentle
line which death could borrow to soften the
stamp with which revenge and bitterness had
branded her. So she would look in her coffin,
Lucy thought with awe. Majesty might
come into her face in the last great moment;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
but it would be the majesty of hate, not of
love.</p>
<p>What a sad, sad ending to a life!</p>
<p>As the girl sat thinking of the friendless, isolated
existence of the woman before her, she
wondered idly what her aunt would have been,
if, while her nature was still plastic, she had
married and sacrificed her ego in years of service
for others. Ah, she would never then
have come to this lonely, embittered old age!
Children would have prattled at her knee,
and their children would have made glad
the silent house. How full of joy and
opportunity such an existence would have
been!</p>
<p>But these blessings, alas, had not been
granted Ellen. Perhaps it had been her own
fault. She may deliberately have thrust the
gentle visitant, Love, from her dwelling, and
once repulsed he may never have sought again
for entrance.</p>
<p>Or it might be the woman was one at whose
door the god had never knocked. Oh, the pity
of it!</p>
<p>For after all did life hold any gift so rare,
so supreme, as the perfect devotion of a man
and woman who loved one another. It must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
be a wonderful thing, that divine miracle of
Love.</p>
<p>Dreamily Lucy&#8217;s gaze wandered off to the
sunny fields, and with solemn realization it
came to her that should Ellen die, they and all
the Webster lands would be hers, to do with as
she pleased. There were so many things she
had been powerless to get her aunt to do. The
house needed repairs if it were to be preserved
for coming generations: certain patches of soil
had been worked too long and should be allowed
to lie fallow; there were scores of other
improvements she would like to see carried out.
Now she would be free to better the property
as she saw fit. She would talk with Martin
Howe about it. He was brimming with all
the latest farming methods. She would get
him to buy her a cultivator such as he used in
his own garden, and a wheel-hoe. He could
advise her, too, about plowing buckwheat into
the soil. And Martin would know what to do
about shingling the barn and cementing the
cellar.</p>
<p>In fact, it was amazing to discover how inseparable
Martin seemed to be from her plans.
He was so strong, so wise, just the type of man
a woman could depend upon for sympathy and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
guidance. Absently she twisted the ring on
her finger.</p>
<p>Her mind had traveled to the events of the
morning, to his battle with himself and final
victory. How appealing had been his surrender!
The stern personality had melted
into a tenderness as winning as a child&#8217;s.</p>
<p>If he loved a woman and she loved him&mdash;&mdash;
She started guiltily to find Ellen staring at her
with vague, troubled eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&mdash;where&mdash;am&mdash;I&mdash;?&#8221; asked the
woman in a weak, quavering voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upstairs in your own room, Aunt Ellen,&#8221;
replied Lucy gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d I come here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t feel very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I remember now. I fell, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was fussin&#8217; at somethin&#8217;, an&#8217; it made me
dizzy. &#8217;Twas the heat, I guess. Where&#8217;d you
find me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you managed to bring me here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her niece hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered firmly.</p>
<p>Ellen paused and with dread the girl awaited
her next question. But no question came.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
Either the clouded mind was in too vague a
mood to grasp details, or the invalid did not
care. She seemed to be thinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I fell,&#8221; she repeated at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again there was a pause, and during the
stillness Lucy plainly heard the sound of approaching
wagon wheels. It must be Martin
with the doctor. She rose softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where you goin&#8217;?&#8221; demanded her aunt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just downstairs a minute. I think the
doctor&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t send Tony for the doctor!&#8221;
the invalid exclaimed, a feeble querulousness
vibrating in the words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I didn&#8217;t know what else to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t help any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you he can&#8217;t,&#8221; snapped Ellen. &#8220;I
know well enough what&#8217;s the matter with me
without bein&#8217; told. I&#8217;ve had a shock. My
feet are all cold and numb: I can&#8217;t feel nothin&#8217;
in &#8217;em, nor move &#8217;em. There ain&#8217;t no remedy
for that. You&#8217;re only wastin&#8217; money gettin&#8217;
the man here to tell me what I already know.
I shan&#8217;t see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy waited a moment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I sent for him if you don&#8217;t want
him,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But now that he is here,
don&#8217;t you think he&#8217;d better come up? We
don&#8217;t need to have him come again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen did not respond at once. Then with
more animation than she had exhibited, she
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose we&#8217;ll have to pay him whether he
comes up or not, so I may&#8217;s well get my
money&#8217;s worth out of him. Go and fetch him.
He&#8217;ll likely be tickled to death to see with his
own eyes how bad off I am so&#8217;st he can go back
an&#8217; blab the news in the village. Folks will be
thankful to have something new to talk about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy could not but smile at the characteristic
remark. She went out and soon returned
with Doctor Marsh tiptoeing gingerly behind
her.</p>
<p>He was a heavy, florid man whom the combination
of heat and speed had transformed
into a panting mechanism. Mopping the
beads of perspiration from his brow, he started
to seat himself at Ellen&#8217;s bedside, but the
woman waved him off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t come any nearer,&#8221; she called, &#8220;and
don&#8217;t bring that bag of pills and plasters in
here, either. I shan&#8217;t need nothin&#8217; you&#8217;ve got.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
I know that well&#8217;s you do; an&#8217; I know better&#8217;n
you do that there ain&#8217;t no help for me. You
needn&#8217;t stay, an&#8217; you needn&#8217;t come in. Good
mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having delivered herself of this ultimatum
at a single breath, Ellen turned her head and
closed her eyes.</p>
<p>The doctor looked at her in astonishment but
did not move.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clip right along home,&#8221; reiterated the sick
woman without looking at the physician.
&#8220;My niece&#8217;ll pay you as you go out. I reckon
you won&#8217;t charge more&#8217;n half price, since you
ain&#8217;t done nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I usually have&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe. But this call ain&#8217;t like your usual
ones, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; responded the doctor with dignity,
&#8220;I can&#8217;t say that it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you can&#8217;t expect to get so much for
it,&#8221; piped Ellen triumphantly. &#8220;My niece
will settle with you. Give him a dollar, Lucy&mdash;not
a cent more. He&#8217;ll have fun enough
gossipin&#8217; about me to make up the rest of the
fee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Marsh, his face a study in outraged
decorum, stalked indignantly from the room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
Ellen, peeping from beneath her lids, watched
him with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he gone?&#8221; she demanded, when Lucy
returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank the Lord. The fool doesn&#8217;t know
anything, anyway. Now you go back downstairs
an&#8217; finish up your work. There ain&#8217;t no
call for you to be idlin&#8217; the day out, even if I
am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to leave you alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh, pooh! I can&#8217;t no more&#8217;n die, an&#8217; if
I was to start doin&#8217; that you couldn&#8217;t stop me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy moved toward the door; then turning
she remarked gently:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry, Aunt Ellen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you&#8217;re ill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you?&#8221; questioned the old woman,
searching the girl&#8217;s face with her small, flinty
eyes. &#8220;Mebbe you are. You generally tell
the truth. I guess if you do feel so, you&#8217;re the
only one; an&#8217; I don&#8217;t quite see how even you
can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her aunt fingered the sheet nervously.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good girl, Lucy,&#8221; she presently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
observed in a weary tone. &#8220;You won&#8217;t lose
nothin&#8217; by it, neither.&#8221;</p>
<p>Embarrassed, her niece started from the
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back here a minute,&#8221; muttered the
woman drowsily. &#8220;I want to speak to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy recrossed the threshold and bent over
Ellen, who had sunk back on the pillows and
was beckoning to her with a feeble, exhausted
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll stay by me, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; she pleaded
in a whisper, for the first time displaying a consciousness
of her helpless, dependent condition.
&#8220;Promise you won&#8217;t desert me. I&#8217;m leavin&#8217;
you the place an&#8217; ten thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>MELVINY ARRIVES</h3>
</div>

<p>When Lucy descended to the kitchen she
was surprised to be confronted by Jane Howe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin told us your aunt was sick, so I
came over to see what I could do,&#8221; said the visitor
softly. &#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re all up in a heap.
Sickness makes a sight of trouble. I know
what it is &#8217;cause I&#8217;ve had it. Let me take right
hold and put the kitchen to rights for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words were hearty with sincerity, and
the woman&#8217;s intention of rendering neighborly
assistance genuine, for she promptly produced
a large pinafore from under her arm and proceeded
to put it on.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just as good as you can be,&#8221; Lucy
exclaimed. &#8220;But indeed I couldn&#8217;t think of
letting you do my work, especially on such a
hot day as this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? Didn&#8217;t I just tell you I came
to help? If you wasn&#8217;t to let me lend a hand
when you were in a tight place, I&#8217;d feel it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
warn&#8217;t kind of you,&#8221; protested Jane, aggrieved.
&#8220;Fetch the broom, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll go straight to
sweepin&#8217; up. My, but you have a fine big
kitchen here, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>As she rolled up her sleeves she glanced
about.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a monstrous house though,&#8221; she went
on a minute later. &#8220;You&#8217;ll never be able to
do all there&#8217;ll be to do now, unless you have
help. Let alone the work, you never can manage
to lift your aunt by yourself. I reckon
you&#8217;ll have to send for Melviny Grey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who, pray, is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Melviny? Ain&#8217;t you never heard of Melviny?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane regarded Lucy with astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, that&#8217;s because you warn&#8217;t born
and raised here,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;Why, Melviny&#8217;s
one of the institutions of Sefton Falls.
Nothin&#8217; goes on in the way of tribulation without
Melviny bein&#8217; to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see. She&#8217;s a nurse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you couldn&#8217;t really call her that,&#8221; replied
Jane thoughtfully. &#8220;An&#8217; still I don&#8217;t
know but you might as well tag her that way
as any. &#8217;Twould be hard to tell just what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
Melviny is. She ain&#8217;t only a nurse, &#8217;cause she&#8217;s
a dressmaker; an&#8217; she ain&#8217;t exactly a dressmaker,
&#8217;cause she makes bonnets; besides that
she cleans house for folks, puts up pickles, and
tends all the new babies. Melviny&#8217;s just a sort
of present help in time of trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe, too, she ain&#8217;t busy just now&mdash;not
more&#8217;n ordinarily busy, I mean,&#8221; Jane hastened
to add quickly. &#8220;As I remember it, the
Bartons&#8217; baby&#8217;s just come, an&#8217; the Wheeler one
ain&#8217;t due yet; so I guess Melviny&#8217;s yours for
the askin&#8217;. An&#8217; if you can get her, you&#8217;ll have
a whole team.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether Aunt Ellen&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
began Lucy uneasily, but Jane interrupted
her:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it ain&#8217;t to be expected your aunt will
want her,&#8221; she cut in serenely. &#8220;She won&#8217;t
want anybody. &#8217;Twill drive her well-nigh
crazy to think of spendin&#8217; the money. But
&#8217;tain&#8217;t right for you to try to do all there is to
be done alone, an&#8217; you mustn&#8217;t undertake it.
Just go right ahead an&#8217; get somebody in,
whether your aunt likes it or not. That&#8217;s the
way I&#8217;d do if it was Martin. Besides, &#8217;tain&#8217;t as
if Melviny was different. She fits in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
anywhere. She warn&#8217;t ever known not to. She
asks no questions an&#8217; has got no opinions. She
just sorter goes along as if she was walkin&#8217; in
her sleep, turnin&#8217; neither to the right nor to the
left. Whatever house she&#8217;s in, it&#8217;s all the same
to her. I believe she&#8217;d jog up to a patient with
a breakfast tray if the stairs was burnin&#8217; under
her. Nothin&#8217; moves her.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a rippling laugh from Lucy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d have to have somebody like that,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly would,&#8221; agreed Jane.
&#8220;That&#8217;s why I feel Melviny&#8217;s just the one for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so good of you to be interested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless your heart, I reckon the whole town&#8217;s
interested in Miss Webster bein&#8217; took down,&#8221;
confessed Jane naively. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t deserve
no credit for this plan; &#8217;twas Martin&#8217;s idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mar&mdash;your brother&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Martin&#8217;s awful upset &#8217;bout your
aunt bein&#8217; sick,&#8221; announced Jane. &#8220;He must
&#8217;a&#8217; heard it in the village when he was there
this mornin&#8217;, for the minute he got back he sent
me over to urge you to get somebody in.
&#8217;Course he wouldn&#8217;t come himself. That
would be too much to expect. But he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
actually said that if you decided to fetch Melviny
he&#8217;d go and get her&mdash;an&#8217; from him that means
a heap. I &#8217;most fell over backwards when he
suggested it, for you know how Martin feels
toward your aunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy nodded in confusion. She had an uncomfortable
sense that she was not being quite
frank with Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin would do &#8217;bout anything for you,
Miss Lucy,&#8221; the woman asserted in a sudden
burst of confidence. &#8220;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A cry from upstairs cut short the sentence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Aunt Ellen, I&#8217;ll be right there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go right up: I&#8217;ll finish things here,&#8221; whispered
Jane hurriedly. &#8220;All is, if you want
Martin to go for Melviny, you have only to
say the word. You can wave a handkerchief
out of the window, an&#8217; he&#8217;ll understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where does Miss Grey&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the land sake don&#8217;t call her that. Nobody&#8217;d
know who you meant, an&#8217; she wouldn&#8217;t,
either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Melviny, then&mdash;where does she
live?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Down in the valley&mdash;King&#8217;s Hollow, they
call it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s miles!&#8221; protested Lucy in dismay.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t send your brother way down
there. He&#8217;s been doing nothing but errands
all day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; Jane replied. &#8220;He&#8217;s been to
town twice already. He came home this noon
with a load of grain an&#8217; then changed horses
an&#8217; went right back to the village again &#8217;cause
he forgot something. Likely you noticed him
drivin&#8217; past.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl colored before Jane&#8217;s friendly
glance. She longed to tell the whole truth,
for by nature she was a person of great frankness.
Since, however, Martin had not seen
fit to enlighten his sisters, perhaps it was wiser
that she should not do so. He may have had
his own reasons for keeping them in ignorance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m coming, Aunt Ellen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do go along,&#8221; implored Jane; &#8220;she may
suspect something. I&#8217;ll leave the house all
picked up, tidy as a pin. You won&#8217;t forget to
wave to Martin if you want him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Thank you a thousand times, Ja&mdash;Miss
Howe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane&#8217;ll do,&#8221; smiled the woman kindly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m more used to it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>Catching her visitor&#8217;s hand in a quick grasp,
Lucy pressed it warmly and then sped up the
stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever have you been putterin&#8217; about
so long?&#8221; queried Ellen petulantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was clearing up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. I guess the place needed it,&#8221;
sighed her aunt. &#8220;I warn&#8217;t half through
straightenin&#8217; things in the kitchen. I thought
I heard you talkin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heard me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably &#8217;twas a notion. My head kinder
buzzes.&#8221; Then she suddenly turned suspiciously
on the girl, adding sharply:</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t been over to the Howes&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. An&#8217; don&#8217;t you go, neither.
We don&#8217;t need no help from them.&#8221;</p>
<p>A pause followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you want me for something?&#8221; Lucy
at last inquired, after waiting for her aunt to
speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless Ellen made no further remark
for some time. Finally she burst out fretfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m almighty afraid I&#8217;ll have to hire in
somebody, after all.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>The last two words were peculiarly illuminating.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean somebody to help?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; grumbled the older woman with
peevish shrillness. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a pull ahead
of us; I know that well enough. An&#8217; I s&#8217;pose
you ain&#8217;t got enough muscle to lift me. Likely
you couldn&#8217;t even raise me up on the pillows if
you was to try. How you ever got me upstairs
beats all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy hastily turned her head aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;They do say, though,&#8221; continued Ellen,
&#8220;that sometimes when folks are scat to death
they can do things they can&#8217;t do any other time.
You were scat, I s&#8217;pose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe you was scat worse when you
found I warn&#8217;t dead,&#8221; chuckled the sick woman
disagreeably.</p>
<p>The girl did not reply. Ellen paused; then
seemed to regret her ill humor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now &#8217;bout a woman&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She halted
abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any one in mind?&#8221; Lucy asked
timidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; returned Ellen emphatically, &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t. I hate all the folks in this town about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
equally&mdash;that is, all except the Howes,&#8221; she
concluded with significant emphasis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there a nurse in the village?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Melviny Grey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she a nurse?&#8221; the girl inquired innocently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Melviny ain&#8217;t never been classified,&#8221; retorted
Ellen grimly. &#8220;She&#8217;s neither fish, flesh
nor fowl. She&#8217;s taught school; laid out the
dead; an&#8217; done the Lord only knows what
durin&#8217; her lifetime. She can turn her hand to
most anything; an&#8217; they do say she&#8217;s mum as
an oyster, which is a virtue out of the common
in a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose I see if we can get her?&#8221; suggested
Lucy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; returned Ellen, with a reluctant
groan, &#8220;I reckon you&#8217;ll have to. You can
send Tony for her when he gets back, though
how he&#8217;ll find her I don&#8217;t know. You might&#8217;s
well hunt for a needle in a haystack as to track
down Melviny. She&#8217;s liable to be most anywheres
tendin&#8217; babies or trimmin&#8217; bunnits; an&#8217;
Tony&#8217;s such a numskull.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we can locate her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, pack him off anyhow, the minute he
gets home; an&#8217; tell him not to do any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
unnecessary travelin&#8217;, an&#8217; to keep where the ground is
smooth if he can. There&#8217;s no use wearin&#8217; out
Dolly&#8217;s new shoes by trapesin&#8217; over the stones
in &#8217;em the first thing. Don&#8217;t be afraid to speak
up good and sharp to Tony. He&#8217;s used to it
an&#8217; understands it better. Ain&#8217;t it the devil&#8217;s
own luck I should be chained down here like
this!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ll be better before long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool,&#8221; snarled Ellen. &#8220;Of
course I shan&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, and Lucy saw her face
first harden into a rebellious frown, then relax
into sleep. As soon as the girl was quite sure
she would not be heard, she went to the window
and, drawing aside the curtain, waved her
handkerchief.</p>
<p>Evidently Martin Howe was awaiting the
signal, for on receiving it he sprang up from
the chopping block where he was sitting and,
returning the salute, disappeared into the barn
from which he presently emerged with his surrey
and bay mare.</p>
<p>Lucy lingered to see him rattle out of the
yard and pass over the crest of the hill. Then
with a strange sense of comfort and companionship
she went back to her aunt&#8217;s room. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
sat there until dusk, watching the sleeping
woman upon the bed.</p>
<p>Then Melvina arrived. She proved to be a
large, placid-faced woman with a countenance
from which every human emotion had been
eliminated until it was as expressionless as a
bronze Buddha. If she had ever known sorrow,
delight, affection, surprise, it was so long
ago that her reactionary system had forgotten
how to reflect these sensations. It was obvious
that nothing concerned her outside her immediate
calling and that she accepted this with a
stoical immovability which was neither to be
diverted nor influenced.</p>
<p>Taking Lucy&#8217;s hand in a loose, pudgy grasp
she remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;A shock?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you see, my aunt&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How old is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A little over seventy-five. I was away
and when I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First shock?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Upstairs. But before you see her I want
to explain that she is a little&mdash;well, peculiar.
You may find that she&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t pay no attention,&#8221; replied Melvina
indifferently. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen all sorts&mdash;fretters,
groaners, whiners, scolders; they&#8217;re all one to
me. So you needn&#8217;t give yourself any uneasiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke in a voice as humdrum and colorless
as was her round, flabby face, and Lucy
smiled in spite of herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy it isn&#8217;t really necessary for me to
tell you anything then,&#8221; she answered good-humoredly.
&#8220;Of course you have had a wonderful
chance to study personalities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never had a chance to study anything,&#8221;
responded Melvina in a matter-of-fact manner.
&#8220;All I know I&#8217;ve picked up as I went along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By study I mean that you have had a wide
opportunity to observe human nature,&#8221; explained
Lucy.</p>
<p>&#8220;If by human nature you mean folks, I
have,&#8221; Melvina said in her habitual monotone.</p>
<p>After answering the remark, however, she
made no further attempt at conversation but
lapsed into a patient silence, regarding Lucy
with her big, faded blue eyes. As she stood
there, one gained an impression that she could
have stood thus for an indefinite length of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
time&mdash;forever, if necessary. Not once did her
gaze wander to her surroundings, and when
Lucy conducted her to the room that had been
assigned her she entered it without curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will be comfortable here,&#8221; the
girl murmured with a hostess&#8217;s solicitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if there is anything you want&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ask for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although there was no rebuke in the utterance,
before this monument of composure,
Lucy, like David Copperfield in the presence
of the waiter, suddenly felt very young.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you; I wish you would,&#8221; she managed
to stammer, hastily closing the door.</p>
<p>She reflected with amusement, as she made
her retreat, that there were several things she
had intended to caution the new nurse not to
mention, one being that it was Martin Howe
who had brought her hither. But after having
once seen Melvina Grey, such warnings became
superfluous and absurd. There was no
more probability of Melvina&#8217;s imparting to
Ellen the circumstances of her coming than
there was of the rocks on the mountain side
breaking into speech and voicing their past history.
Therefore she crept downstairs to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
kitchen to prepare supper, pondering as she
went as to how Ellen and this strangely stolid
attendant would get on together.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be like a storm dashing against
granite cliffs,&#8221; she thought whimsically.
&#8220;Well, there is one merciful thing about it&mdash;I
shall not have to worry about Melviny gossiping
or telling tales.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this assumption Lucy was quite right.
Melvina Grey proved not only to be as dumb
as an oyster but even more uncommunicative
than that traditionally self-contained bivalve.
Notwithstanding her cheery conversation about
the weather, the crops, Sefton Falls, the scenery,
she never trespassed upon personalities,
or offered an observation concerning her immediate
environment; nor could she be beguiled
into narrating what old Herman Cole
died of, or whether he liked his son&#8217;s wife or
not. This was aggravating, for Melvina had
been two years a nurse in the Cole family and
was well qualified to clear up these vexed
questions. Equally futile, too, were Ellen&#8217;s
attempts to wring from her lips any confidential
information about the Hoyles&#8217; financial
tangles, despite the fact that she had been in the
house during the tragedy of Samuel Hoyle&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
failure and had welcomed the Hoyle baby into
the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the woman&#8217;s a clam&mdash;that&#8217;s what
she is!&#8221; announced the exasperated patient.
&#8220;You can get nothin&#8217; out of her. She might
as well not know anything if she&#8217;s going to be
that close-mouthed. I don&#8217;t believe hot irons
would drag the words out of her. Anyhow,
she won&#8217;t go retailin&#8217; our affairs all over town
after she goes from here; that&#8217;s one comfort!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy endorsed the observation with enthusiasm.
It was indeed just as well that Melvina
did not report in the sick room all that went on
downstairs.</p>
<p>What, for example, would have been Ellen&#8217;s
feeling had she known that every morning
some one of the Howe sisters came stealing
across the fields to help with the Webster
housework? And what would she have said
on discovering that it was her hereditary enemy
Martin himself who not only directed the cultivation
of her garden but assumed much of its
actual work.</p>
<p>Ah, Ellen would have writhed in her bed had
such tidings been borne to her. She would, in
truth, probably have done far more than writhe
had she been cognizant that every evening this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
same Mr. Martin Howe, arrayed with scrupulous
care, leaped the historic wall and came to
sit on the Webster doorstep and discuss problems
relative to plowing and planting. And
if, as frequently happened, the talk wandered
off from cabbages and turnips to sunsets and
moon glades, and if sometimes there were conscious
intervals when there was no talk at all,
who was the wiser? Certainly not Ellen, who
in her dim chamber little suspected that the
pair who whispered beneath her window had
long since become as oblivious to the fact that
they were Howe and Webster as were Romeo
and Juliet that they were Montague and
Capulet.</p>
<p>No, the weeks passed, and Ellen lay in blissful
ignorance that the shuttle of Fate, ever
speeding to and fro, was subtly entangling in
its delicate meshes these heirs of an inherited
hatred.</p>
<p>Martin&#8217;s sisters saw the romance and rejoiced;
and although she gave no sign, Melvina
Grey must also have seen it.</p>
<p>As for the man and his beloved, they dwelt
apart in an ephemeral world where only the
prosaic hours when they were separated were
unreal. Their realities were smiles, sighs,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
glances,&mdash;the thousand and one nothings that
make up the joys and agonies of a lover&#8217;s existence.
Thus the weeks passed.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, as a result of rest and
good care, Ellen steadily became stronger and
soon reached a point where it was no empty
platitude to assure her that she was really
better.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do believe we shall have you downstairs
yet, Aunt Ellen,&#8221; said Lucy gaily. &#8220;You are
gaining every minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time I gained,&#8221; Ellen retorted with
acidity.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re gainin&#8217; all right,&#8221; echoed Melvina.
&#8220;I plan to have you settin&#8217; up soon. Sometime,
when you&#8217;re havin&#8217; a good day an&#8217; feel
real spry, I mean to hist you into a chair an&#8217;
let you take a look at the view.&#8221;</p>
<p>The date for this innovation came sooner
than either Lucy or the optimistic nurse foresaw,
for Ellen continued to mend so rapidly
that one afternoon, when twilight was deepening
into purple, Melvina proposed to attempt
the experiment of moving the invalid.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you like to try settin&#8217; up a spell
to-night?&#8221; she inquired without preamble.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll get a chair ready, and fix you in it, an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
shove you over to the window so&#8217;st you can
look out. There ain&#8217;t much to see, to be sure;
still the change will rest you, an&#8217; mebbe you&#8217;ll
sleep better after it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen did not demur. Melvina had proved
herself a trustworthy pilot and demonstrated
that her suggestions were worth considering.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Only hadn&#8217;t you
better call Lucy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>A contemptuous smile curled Melvina&#8217;s
lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless your soul an&#8217; body, I&#8217;ve no need of
help,&#8221; was her answer. &#8220;You don&#8217;t weigh
nothin&#8217;, an&#8217; even if you did, I&#8217;ve moved so
many folks that I wouldn&#8217;t hesitate. You
ain&#8217;t afraid, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy, no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no cause for you to be,&#8221; went on
the nurse reassuringly. &#8220;I know what I&#8217;m
about. All you&#8217;ve got to do is to mind what I
tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen&#8217;s jaw squared itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;spect that&#8217;s about all I&#8217;ll ever do again,&#8221;
she returned in a biting tone.</p>
<p>The proposed adventure subsequently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
resolved itself into a much simpler undertaking
than it had promised, for Ellen was light as a
feather and Melvina strong, deft, and experienced.
Hence without mishap the invalid was
transferred to the big chair and rolled to the
window, where she could look out on the valley
melting into the shadows of evening.</p>
<p>Had she restricted her observations to the
scenery she might have returned to her couch
refreshed both in mind and body; but unluckily
she chanced to let her glance wander to the
garden, and there an astonishing sight met her
eyes.</p>
<p>In the seclusion of the lilac hedge stood two
figures, that of a man and a woman. The man
held in his hand a trowel and was transplanting
in the rich brown soil some tender green things
which the woman was handing him from a
basket. The presence of a stranger who was
apparently so much at home within her boundaries
was in itself sufficient to arouse Ellen&#8217;s
curiosity; but what whetted curiosity to indignation
was the manner in which the pair were
performing the simple task. Even a person
blind to romance and deaf to sentiment could
not help realizing that the planting was a very
immaterial part of the pastoral tableau, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
there was much more significance in the drama
than the setting out of young seedlings.</p>
<p>Fascinated, Ellen gazed, her wrath rising.</p>
<p>&#8220;Melviny!&#8221; she burst out at last, &#8220;come
here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Webster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that out in the garden?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over there near the lilac hedge,&#8221; specified
Ellen impatiently.</p>
<p>Melvina rubbed her glasses then smothered
a little gasp; but she quickly recovered her
wonted stolidity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Miss Lucy, I reckon,&#8221; she said slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the man&mdash;the man!&#8221; persisted Ellen.
&#8220;Who is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the man. That&#8217;s Mr. Howe&mdash;the one
that lives next door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin Howe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I believe they do call him Martin,&#8221;
responded Melvina imperturbably, resuming
her interrupted task of turning the mattress
and plumping its feathers into luxurious billows
of softness.</p>
<p>Ellen did not speak immediately. When
she did it was to ask:</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Martin Howe doin&#8217; on my land?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Helpin&#8217;, I s&#8217;pose,&#8221; Melvina replied with
indifference. &#8220;He often does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He comes over here an&#8217; works?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, marm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen brought her fist down on the arm of
the chair with an exclamation of anger. Her
lips were white, and she trembled. Raising
her unsteady finger, she pointed toward the
unconscious culprits.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go straight out there, Melvina,&#8221; she
cried, &#8220;an&#8217; tell Lucy I want her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, marm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>She watched while Melvina plodded across
the grass and delivered her message. Instantly
Lucy dropped the basket and hastened toward
the house. Another moment the girl stood before
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re worse, Aunt Ellen?&#8221; she said,
panting for breath.</p>
<p>But Ellen ignored the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Martin Howe doin&#8217; in my garden?&#8221;
she demanded fiercely.</p>
<p>Lucy paled.</p>
<p>&#8220;He came over to help me transplant the
larkspur.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>&#8220;By what right does he come over here, I&#8217;d
like to know?&#8221;</p>
<p>No reply came.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he been over before?&#8221; interrogated
Ellen ruthlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, off an&#8217; on. He&#8217;s been trying to help
out since you&#8217;ve been ill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Help out!&#8221; repeated Ellen scornfully.
&#8220;The coward! He wouldn&#8217;t have dared set
foot on the place if I&#8217;d been well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t a coward!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy had drawn herself to her full height
and now confronted her aunt with blazing
eyes. Ellen, however, was not to be deterred.</p>
<p>&#8220;He <i>is</i> a coward!&#8221; she reiterated. &#8220;A coward
an&#8217; a blackguard! A curse on the
Howes&mdash;the whole lot of &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221;</p>
<p>The intonation of the single word brought
Ellen&#8217;s harangue to an abrupt cessation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shan&#8217;t speak so of Martin Howe or
of his family,&#8221; cried the girl. &#8220;He is no coward.
If he had been as small-minded and cruel
as you, he would have left you to die on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
floor the day you fell, instead of bringing you
upstairs and going for a doctor&mdash;you, who
have cursed him! You had better know the
truth. Did you think it was I who placed you
on this bed? I couldn&#8217;t have done it. I am
not strong enough. It was Martin&mdash;Martin
Howe!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen stared stupidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather have died!&#8221; she muttered between
clinched teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you would,&#8221; retorted Lucy. &#8220;You
would rather have gone down to your grave
with bitterness in your soul and a curse upon
your lips than to have accepted aid from Martin
Howe. You would not have helped him
had he been in trouble. You would have been
glad to see him suffer&mdash;glad!&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman listened as if spellbound.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Martin Howe is too much of a Christian
for that. Yes, you can sneer. He is a
Christian and a gentleman. You are not
worthy to touch the ground beneath his feet.
He would not leave you without help. Since
you have been ill, he has given part of each day
to working in your garden; and he is busy and
tired, too. He&#8217;s done it that your crops might
not fail. It is Martin Howe that you have to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
thank for your harvest, whether you like it or
not&mdash;Martin Howe!&#8221;</p>
<p>Breathlessly she paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to have a terrible high opinion
of Martin Howe,&#8221; scoffed Ellen, with scathing
sarcasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Likely you&#8217;re in love with him,&#8221; jibed the
tormentor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I love him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The simple confession came proudly from
the girl&#8217;s lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; he loves you, no doubt,&#8221; continued the
old woman with a laugh. &#8220;At least he&#8217;s probably
told you so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he hasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh-ho! He hasn&#8217;t, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; never will,&#8221; shouted the harpy triumphantly.
&#8220;He ain&#8217;t marryin&#8217; no Websters&mdash;don&#8217;t
you think it for one minute. He&#8217;s
just makin&#8217; a fool of you. That&#8217;s his idea of
revenge&mdash;your Christian gentleman!&#8221;</p>
<p>She rubbed her dank hands together.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t be likely to,&#8221; returned Ellen
sharply. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect it. No girl is ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
willin&#8217; to believe her lover&#8217;s a scoundrel. But
mark my words&mdash;Martin Howe is playin&#8217; with
you&mdash;playin&#8217;&mdash;just the way a cat plays with a
mouse. He&#8217;s aimin&#8217; to get you into his clutches
an&#8217; ruin you&mdash;wait an&#8217; see if he ain&#8217;t. Oh,
he&#8217;s a deep one, this gentleman you seem to
think so much of!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not believe it,&#8221; repeated Lucy hotly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d marry him, I s&#8217;pose,&#8221; Ellen hissed.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he asked me, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You traitor! An&#8217; you a Webster!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman surveyed her niece in silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said finally, &#8220;you can put your
soul at rest. Martin Howe will never marry
you&mdash;never! He would no more marry anybody
of the Webster blood than he&#8217;d hang himself.
Go on lovin&#8217; him if you want to. No
good will come of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this parting prophecy Ellen shut her
lips, and Lucy, throbbing from the stripes of
the encounter and seeing further parley fruitless,
slipped from the room and fled to the quiet
of the still night&#8217;s solitude.</p>
<p>After she had gone and Ellen was once more
in bed, Melvina tried in vain to quiet the increasing
restlessness of her patient, but all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
attempts to soothe the invalid were without avail.
Tossing from side to side on the pillows, her
fingers picking nervously at the coverings,
Ellen stared into the darkness, breaking from
time to time into fragments of angry dialogue.</p>
<p>The benediction of the evening&#8217;s peace,
musical with the rustling of leaves and laden
with the perfume of blossoming vines, brought
no solace to her heart. Presently, unable to
endure the silence longer, she started up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Melviny,&#8221; she called to the woman sitting
beside her.</p>
<p>The nurse rose from the deepening gloom
and stood erect in the moonlight, her figure
throwing upon the whitewashed wall a distorted,
specterlike silhouette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, marm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Lucy still outdoors?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen waited an instant; then she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s somethin&#8217; in her room I want you
should get for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Miss Webster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long white envelope. You&#8217;ll find it
somewheres. It&#8217;ll likely be in her desk or the
table drawer. It&#8217;s sealed with red wax.
You&#8217;ll know it when you come across it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>Although Melvina nodded, she did not move.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be afraid to fetch it,&#8221; explained
Ellen querulously. &#8220;It&#8217;s mine. I
gave it to Lucy to keep for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melvina started promptly on her quest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be all night about it,&#8221; was Ellen&#8217;s
parting admonition.</p>
<p>While the messenger was gone, the invalid
gave vent to her impatience by drumming
rhythmically on the wooden edge of the bedstead,
and this measured tattoo increased in
speed until it beat time with the feverish
bounding of her pulse and the throbbing of her
heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you found it yet?&#8221; she shouted at
last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve just come on it. It was under&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter where it was. Bring it here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m comin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bearing the envelope, Melvina appeared in
the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see it,&#8221; said Ellen.</p>
<p>She took it in her hand and, while Melvina
held the candle, examined the package critically.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; she muttered. &#8220;It&#8217;s good as
new.&#8221;</p>
<p>For some unaccountable reason she seemed
disappointed at the discovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now run downstairs and put it in the
stove,&#8221; she commanded excitedly. &#8220;Wait till
every smitch of it&#8217;s burned up an&#8217; then come
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, marm.&#8221;</p>
<p>But again Melvina loitered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you the thing is mine to do with as I
please,&#8221; declared Ellen angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, marm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-e-s.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she heard the nurse&#8217;s reluctant step on
the stairs, an evil light came into the old
woman&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix that!&#8221; she whispered aloud.</p>
<p>It took Melvina some time to fulfill her
errand, but at length she returned, and the
moment she was inside the door Ellen&#8217;s shrill
query greeted her:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, did you burn it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, marm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every scrap of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t leave nothin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman in the bed drew a satisfied
breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right then. Now get me a drink
of water, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll go to sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sleep she craved, however, did not come,
for throughout the night she continued to move
unceasingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your aunt didn&#8217;t so much as close her
eyes,&#8221; announced Melvina to Lucy the next
morning, while the two sat at breakfast.
Nevertheless, although she advanced this information,
with characteristic secretiveness she
said nothing of the happenings of the previous
evening.</p>
<p>Truly if &#8220;Whoso keepeth his mouth and his
tongue keepeth his soul from troubles,&#8221; Melvina&#8217;s
eternal serenity of spirit was assured.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>A PIECE OF DIPLOMACY</h3>
</div>

<p>When Lucy, radiant in her own happiness,
entered her aunt&#8217;s room, she was surprised to
find that all Ellen&#8217;s recent anger had apparently
vanished, and that she had dropped into
a lethargic mood from which it was difficult to
rouse her. It was not so much that the elder
woman was out of temper&mdash;that was to be expected&mdash;as
that she seemed to be turning over
in her mind some problem which was either unsolved
or unpleasant, and which knitted her
brow into a web of wrinkles, forcing her lips
together with an ominous curl.</p>
<p>Lucy, who stood at the table arranging a
vase of freshly gathered pansies, furtively
studied the invalid&#8217;s sullen reverie.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you feeling to-day, Aunt Ellen?&#8221;
she at last inquired with courageous effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;No different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Melvina said she was afraid you did not
have a comfortable night.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>The blue eyes flashed a suspicious glance of
inquiry over the questioner&#8217;s countenance,
then closed wearily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; was all she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry to hear that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The regret was uttered with gentle sincerity.
In an existence cloudless as her own, magnanimousness
required little effort. Moreover,
Lucy was forgiving by nature; and had she not
been, the helplessness and friendlessness of the
lonely soul before her would have presented a
powerful plea for pity.</p>
<p>Ellen did not respond to the words.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was the trouble?&#8221; went on Lucy,
after waiting a suitable length of time and
sensing that no answer was to be forthcoming.
&#8220;Were you in pain?&#8221;</p>
<p>At the interrogation a flame of hatred leaped
into the woman&#8217;s face, flickered there, and then
died down, leaving it cold and hard as marble.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got to thinkin&#8217;,&#8221; she returned briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope what I said did not worry you,
Aunt Ellen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It did last night; but it don&#8217;t now,&#8221; responded
Ellen, with a disagreeable laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. I should be sorry to have
been the cause of your lying here fretting.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t doin&#8217; no frettin&#8217; now,&#8221; repeated
Ellen. Then, changing a subject both seemed
to regard as a delicate one, she asked in a more
natural tone: &#8220;What were you plannin&#8217; to do
this mornin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just the regular things,&#8221; Lucy said
cordially, glad to be once more on safer ground.
&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause I&#8217;m possessed of a hankerin&#8217; for
some raspberries,&#8221; said Ellen. &#8220;I like &#8217;em,
an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t had any for a long time. Somehow
it seems as if they&#8217;d taste awful good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy&#8217;s face lighted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;d be glad to try and get some for
you, Aunt Ellen,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You know
I&#8217;d love to get anything you wanted if
I could. I&#8217;m so pleased that you mentioned
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen twisted her head on the pillow and
began outlining the figures on the counterpane
with her long, misshapen finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose you couldn&#8217;t find enough for a
shortcake, could you?&#8221; she ventured skeptically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but I could. At least, I
could try. Of course it&#8217;s late in the season for
them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>The lean finger continued to follow the
flowered design of the bedcovering.</p>
<p>&#8220;There used to be some late ones up at the
top of Pine Ridge,&#8221; remarked the invalid
casually. &#8220;That would be quite a walk
though, an&#8217; likely further than you&#8217;d care
to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed it wouldn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was fervor in the protest. Already
visions of a morning in the blue and gold
world were shaping themselves in the girl&#8217;s
mind. No doubt Jane Howe would go with
her; probably Martin would be too busy to
leave his work; but if he were not, what a bit
of Paradise they could have together!</p>
<p>Ellen, who read her niece&#8217;s thoughts almost
as readily as if they had been openly expressed,
smiled a malevolent smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good four miles to the Ridge,&#8221; she
remarked. &#8220;Goin&#8217;, comin&#8217;, an&#8217; pickin&#8217; would
take you the whole mornin&#8217;, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it would,&#8221; agreed Lucy.
&#8220;Could you spare me as long as that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I don&#8217;t need nothin&#8217;; an&#8217; if I do,
Melviny can get it. I&#8217;d rather have you go
than not. If you could get me enough berries
for a shortcake it would be worth it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>The note of suppressed eagerness in the
words caused Lucy to regard her aunt with
quick, indefinable suspicion.</p>
<p>But Ellen met the glance unflinchingly, and
with a baffled sense of being mistaken the girl
hurried from the room. When she returned
shortly afterward and paused in the doorway,
she presented a winning picture.</p>
<p>She had donned a short khaki skirt and a
pair of riding leggings such as she had been
accustomed to wear in the West, and the broad
sombrero crowning her golden hair outlined it
like a halo. A simple blouse turned away to
give freedom to the firm white throat completed
the costume. Dimpling with anticipation,
she held up her tin pail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m off, Aunt Ellen,&#8221; she called. &#8220;You
shall have your shortcake if there is a berry
within five miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman listened to the fall of the light
step on the stairs and the fragment of a song
that came from the girl&#8217;s lips until the last note
of the music died away; then she called
Melvina.</p>
<p>&#8220;Melviny!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, marm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you should find Tony and tell him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
to harness up. There&#8217;s somethin&#8217; I need done
in the village.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Miss Webster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring me a sheet of paper an&#8217; a pencil before
you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>The nurse entered with the desired articles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sendin&#8217; to town for Lawyer Benton,&#8221;
announced the patient with elaborate carelessness.</p>
<p>Neither Melvina&#8217;s voice nor her face expressed
the slightest curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some business I must see to right
away, an&#8217; I reckon I may&#8217;s well get it fixed up
this mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, marm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give Tony this note for Mr. Benton and
tell him to fetch him back soon&#8217;s he can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nodding acquiescence, Melvina disappeared.</p>
<p>During the interval between the time the
wheels rattled out of the yard and rattled in
again, Ellen fidgeted at a high-pitched excitement,
starting nervously at every sound.
Sometimes she scowled; and once she burst into
a harsh, cracked peal of laughter. Her
thoughts, whatever they were, seemed to amuse
her vastly.</p>
<p>The moment the tramp of the horse&#8217;s hoofs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
sounded on the gravel outside, she was alert
and called to Melvina, stationed at the window:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that Tony?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, marm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he got Mr. Benton with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Webster. An&#8217; there&#8217;s somebody
else, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. Show Mr. Benton right up
here. You needn&#8217;t wait. I&#8217;ll call you when
I need you. Let the other man sit in the
kitchen &#8217;til we want him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever the mysterious business was, it
took no great while, for before an hour had
passed Melvina, waiting in the hall outside the
chamber door, heard a shrill summons.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can come in now, Melviny,&#8221; Ellen
said. &#8220;There&#8217;s something here I want you
should put your name to; an&#8217; you can fetch
that man who&#8217;s downstairs, an&#8217; Tony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>
<p>When, however, a few seconds later Melvina,
accompanied by the stranger and the wondering
Portuguese boy, entered the patient&#8217;s room,
it was Mr. Benton who stepped into the foreground
and who came obsequiously forward,
pen in hand, to address the attendant.</p>
<p>&#8220;The paper which you are about to sign,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
Miss Grey,&#8221; he began pompously, &#8220;is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
But Ellen cut short his peroration.</p>
<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t make no difference to Melviny
what it is, Mr. Benton,&#8221; she said impatiently.
&#8220;All she&#8217;s got to do is to watch me write my
name, an&#8217; then put hers down where you tell
her, together with Tony an&#8217; the other witness.
That will end it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you think, Miss Webster, that in
justice to Miss Grey, you should inform
her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; snapped Ellen. &#8220;Melviny
don&#8217;t care nothin&#8217; about my affairs. I&#8217;ll write
my name. Then you can give her the pen an&#8217;
let her sign. That&#8217;s all she&#8217;s got to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Mr. Benton was a man of heavy,
impressive appearance, he was in reality a far
less effectual person to combat opposition than
he seemed, and sensing that in the present
instance it was easier to yield than to argue, he
allowed himself to be cowed into submission
and meekly gave the pen to Melvina who with
blind faith inscribed her name on the crisp
white paper in a small cramped hand. Caleb
Saunders, the witness Mr. Benton had brought
with him, next wrote his name, forming each
letter with such conscientiousness that Ellen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
could hardly wait until the painstaking and
elaborate ceremonial was completed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now let Tony sign,&#8221; she ordered imperiously.
&#8220;He needn&#8217;t stop to wash his hands.
A little dirt won&#8217;t be no hindrance, an&#8217; I&#8217;m
in a hurry to get this thing out of the way so
Mr. Benton can go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet notwithstanding Ellen&#8217;s haste, for Tony
to affix his name to the document in question
proved to be little short of a life work. Six
times he had to be instructed on which line to
write; and when on the seventh admonition his
mind but vaguely grasped what was required
of him, the lawyer took his stand at his elbow
and with finger planted like a guidepost on the
paper indicated beyond all chance of error
where the signature was to be placed. When,
however, the pen was redipped and upraised
for the final legal touch, again it faltered.
This time the delay was caused by uncertainties
of spelling, which, it must be confessed, also
baffled the combined intellects of the lawyer
and the two women. Paponollari was not a
name commonly encountered in New England.
The three wrestled with it valiantly, but when
a vote was taken, and it was set down in accordance
with the ruling of the majority, it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
disheartening to discover that, when all was said
and done, the Portuguese lad was not at all
sure whether Tony was his Christian name or
not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; ejaculated Ellen when, after
more debating, the signature was finally inscribed,
&#8220;I&#8217;m clean beat out. Why, I could
have deeded away the whole United States in
the time it&#8217;s taken this lout of a boy to scribble
his name. Is it any wonder that with only a
stupid idiot like this for help, my garden&#8217;s always
behind other folks&#8217;, an&#8217; my chores never
done?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then to the bewildered, nerve-wracked alien
she thundered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t blot it, you fool!&mdash;don&#8217;t blot it!
Can&#8217;t you keep your fingers out of the wet
ink? Heavens, Melviny, do get him out of
here!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tony was only too ready to retire. The
ordeal had strained his patience and had left
his brain feeling the stress of unaccustomed
exercise. Therefore, allowing Melvina to
drive him before her much as she would have
driven a docile Jersey from a cabbage patch,
he made his way downstairs, followed by the
perspiring lawyer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>It was not until both of them were safely on
the road to the village, and the house had assumed
its customary calm that Lucy arrived,
her hair tumbled by the wind and her eyes
glowing like stars.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got your berries, Aunt Ellen,&#8221; she
said, holding aloft a pail heaped with fruit.
&#8220;See what beauties they are! You shall have
a royal shortcake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellen&#8217;s appreciation for some reason was,
however, scanty and confused. She averted
her glance from her niece&#8217;s face, and even at
noontime when the girl appeared bearing a
marvelously baked and yet more marvelously
decorated masterpiece of culinary art, she had
not regained sufficient poise to partake of the
delicacy in any mood save that of furtive and
guilty silence.</p>
<p>Lucy, ever sympathetic, ventured the fear
that the invalid was over-tired, and after the
meal drew the shades that her aunt might
rest.</p>
<p>In the dim light Ellen seemed more at ease
and presently fell into a deep slumber that
lasted until midnight and was broken only by
some phantasy of her dreams which intermittently
brought from her lips a series of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
muttered execrations and bitter, insinuating
laughs.</p>
<p>Toward morning she roused herself and
gave a feeble cry of pain. Instantly alert,
Melvina hastened to her bedside. But by the
time a candle was lighted all human aid was
vain. Ellen Webster was dead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>ELLEN&#8217;S VENGEANCE</h3>
</div>

<p>It was useless to pretend that Ellen&#8217;s death
did not bring to Lucy Webster a sense of relief
and freedom. It was as if some sinister,
menacing power that had suppressed every
spontaneous impulse of her nature had suddenly
been removed and left her free at last
to be herself. Until now she had not realized
how tired she was,&mdash;not alone physically tired
but tired of groping her way to avoid the constant
friction which life with her aunt engendered.</p>
<p>For the first few days after the funeral she
kept Melvina with her and did nothing but
rest. Then returning energy brought back
her normal desire for action, and she began
to readjust her plans. Together the two
women cleaned the house from top to bottom,
rooting into trunks, chests, and cupboards, and
disposing of much of the litter that Ellen had
accumulated. Afterward Melvina took her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
leave, and Lucy turned her mind to renovations.</p>
<p>She would have new paper and fresh paint,
she decided; also the long-coveted chintz hangings;
and to this end she would make an expedition
to the village to see what could be procured
there in the way of artistic materials.
It might be necessary for her to go to Concord,
or even to Boston for the things she wanted.</p>
<p>In the meantime, since she was driving to
town, perhaps she had better take along her
aunt&#8217;s will. There must be formalities to be
observed regarding it, and although she was
not at all sure what they were, Mr. Benton
would of course know.</p>
<p>But search as she would, the white envelope
with its imposing red seal was nowhere to be
found. She went through every drawer in her
bureau, every pigeonhole in her desk; she ransacked
closet and bookshelf; she even emptied
all her belongings upon the bed and examined
each article carefully to see if the missing document
had by any chance strayed into a fantastic
hiding place; but the paper failed to come to
light.</p>
<p>What could have become of it? The envelope
had been there, that she knew. Only a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
week ago she had seen it in the top drawer of
her desk. She would stake her oath that she
had not removed it. Vague disquietude took
possession of her. Tony had always been
honest, and of Melvina&#8217;s integrity there could
be no question. As for Ellen, had she not herself
put the will into the girl&#8217;s keeping&mdash;as a
weapon with which to meet this very emergency?
It was incredible, preposterous to assume
that she had taken it back, especially
when one considered her helplessness to do so
unaided. That solution might as well be dismissed
as ridiculous.</p>
<p>The paper was lost, that was all there was
to it. Lost!</p>
<p>In her own absent-mindedness, or in a moment
of confusion and weariness, she had either
accidentally destroyed it, or she had removed
it from its customary place to a safer spot and
forgotten where she had put it.</p>
<p>Yet, after all, how foolish it was of her to
worry. Doubtless Mr. Benton had a copy of
the document, and if she made full confession
of her stupidity he would know what to do.
Didn&#8217;t lawyers always keep copies of every
legal paper they drew up? They must of
course do so.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>Therefore without breathing a word of her
troubles to the Howes&mdash;not even to Martin&mdash;she
set forth to the village, her dreams of redecorating
the house being thrust, for the time
being, entirely into the background by this disquieting
happening.</p>
<p>Mr. Benton was alone in his stuffy little office
when she arrived. Evidently his professional
duties were not pressing, for he was
hunched up over a small air-tight stove and
amid a smudge of tobacco smoke was reading
&#8220;Pickwick Papers.&#8221; At the entrance of
a client, however, and this client in particular,
he rose in haste, and slipping simultaneously
into his alpaca coat and his legal manner&mdash;the
two seemed to be a one-piece garment&mdash;held
out his hand with a mixture of solicitude and
pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Miss Webster,&#8221; he began. &#8220;I
hope you are well. You have sustained a great
loss since I last beheld you, a great loss.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew forward a second armchair similar
to the one in which he had been sitting and
motioned Lucy to accept it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your aunt was a worthy woman who will
be profoundly missed in the community,&#8221; he
continued in a droning voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>Lucy did not answer. In fact the lawyer
did not seem to expect she would. He was
apparently delivering himself of a series of
observations which came one after the other in
habitual sequence, and which he preferred
should not be interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Death, however, is the common lot of mankind
and must come to us all,&#8221; he went on in
the same singsong tone, &#8220;and I hope that in
the thought of your devotion to the deceased
you will find comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having now terminated the introduction
with which he was accustomed to preface
his remarks on all such occasions, he regarded
the girl in the chair opposite him
benignly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was intending to come to see you,&#8221; he
went on more cheerfully, and yet being careful
to modulate his words so that they might still
retain the bereavement vibration, &#8220;but you
have forestalled me, I see. I did not wish to
hurry you unduly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been tired,&#8221; Lucy replied simply,
&#8220;but I am rested now and quite ready to do
whatever is necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear that, very glad,&#8221; Mr.
Benton returned. &#8220;Of course there is no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
immediate haste; nevertheless it is well to
straighten out such matters as soon as it can
conveniently be done. When do you contemplate
leaving town?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy met the question with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t intend to leave Sefton Falls,&#8221;
she said quickly. &#8220;I have grown very fond of
the place and mean to remain here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; nodded Mr. Benton. &#8220;That is
interesting. I am glad to hear we are not to
lose you from the village.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rubbed his hands and continued to nod
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;About how soon, if I might ask so personal
a question, do you think you could be ready to
hand over the house to the new tenant?&#8221; he at
last ventured with hesitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t understand you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawyer seemed surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew of your aunt&#8217;s will?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew she had made a will, yes, sir. She
gave it to me to keep for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were familiar with the contents
of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not entirely so,&#8221; Lucy answered. &#8220;I
knew she had left me the house and some
money. She told me that much.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>&#8220;U&mdash;u&mdash;m!&#8221; observed Mr. Benton. &#8220;But
the second will&mdash;she spoke to you of that
also?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were not cognizant that a few days
before the deceased passed&mdash;shall we say,
away&#8221;&mdash;he paused mournfully,&mdash;&#8220;that she
made a new will and revoked the previous
one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one told you that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawyer straightened himself. Matters
were becoming interesting.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a second will,&#8221; he declared with
deliberation. &#8220;It was drawn up one morning
in your aunt&#8217;s room, with Miss Melvina
Grey, Mr. Caleb Saunders, and the boy Tony
as witnesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy waited breathlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will,&#8221; went on Mr. Benton, &#8220;provides
for quite a different disposition of the property.
I must beg you to prepare yourself for
a disappointment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl threw back her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, please,&#8221; she commanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a different disposition of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
property,&#8221; repeated Mr. Benton, dwelling on the
cadence of the phrase.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man delayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any reason to suppose, Miss
Webster, that your aunt was&mdash;shall we say annoyed,
with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew she did not like the way I felt about
some things,&#8221; admitted Lucy.</p>
<p>&#8220;But did not some vital difference of opinion
arise between you recently?&#8221; Mr. Benton
persisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spoke my mind to Aunt Ellen the other
day,&#8221; confessed the girl. &#8220;I had to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Then that explains matters!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What matters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The somewhat strange conditions of the
will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having untangled the enigma to his own
satisfaction, Mr. Benton proceeded to sit back
and enjoy its solution all by himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you tell me what they are?&#8221; Lucy
at last inquired impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can enlighten you, yes. In fact, it is my
duty to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rising, he went to the desk drawer and made
a pretense of fumbling through his papers; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
it was easy to see that the document he sought
had been carefully placed on the top of the
sparse, untidy pile that cluttered the interior
of the rickety piece of furniture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;there is no real
need to burden your mind with legal formalities;
nevertheless&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t bother to read me the whole
will,&#8221; broke out Lucy sharply. &#8220;Just tell me
in plain terms what Aunt Ellen has done.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was obvious that Mr. Benton did not at
all relish the off-handedness of the request.</p>
<p>He depended not a little on his professional
pomposity to bolster up a certain lack of confidence
in himself, and stripped of this legal
regalia he shriveled to a very ordinary person
indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your aunt,&#8221; he began in quite a different
tone, &#8220;has left her property to Mr. Martin
Howe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucy recoiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;To whom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Martin Howe.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an oppressive pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;To Martin Howe?&#8221; the girl stammered at
length. &#8220;But there must be some mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Benton met her gaze kindly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I fear there is no mistake, my dear young
lady,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mean because my aunt has cut
me off,&#8221; Lucy explained with pride. &#8220;She
of course had a right to do what she pleased.
But to leave the property to Martin Howe!
Why, she would scarcely speak to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I have gathered,&#8221; the lawyer said.
&#8220;That is what makes the will so remarkable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is preposterous! Martin will never accept
it in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That contingency is also provided for,&#8221;
put in Mr. Benton.</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The property is willed to the legatee&mdash;house,
land, and money&mdash;to be personally occupied
by said beneficiary and not sold, deeded,
or given away on the conditions&mdash;a very unusual
condition this second one&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Again
Mr. Benton stopped, his thumbs and finger
neatly pyramided into a miniature squirrel
cage, over the top of which he regarded his
client meditatively. His reverie appeared to
be intensely interesting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very unusual indeed,&#8221; he presently concluded
absently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; demanded Lucy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, Miss Webster,&#8221; he continued,
starting at the interrogation. &#8220;As I was saying,
the conditions made by the deceased are
unusual&mdash;peculiar, in fact, if I may be permitted
to say so. The property goes to Mr.
Martin Howe on the condition that in six
months&#8217; time he personally rebuilds the wall
lying between the Howe and Webster estates
and now in a state of dilapidation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will never do it,&#8221; burst out Lucy indignantly,
springing to her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case the property goes unreservedly
to the town of Sefton Falls,&#8221; went on Mr.
Benton in an even tone, &#8220;to be used as a home
for the destitute of the county.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl clinched her hands. It was a
trap,&mdash;a last, revengeful, defiant act of hatred.</p>
<p>The pity that any one should go down into
the grave with such bitterness of heart was the
girl&#8217;s first thought.</p>
<p>Then the cleverness of the old woman&#8217;s plot
began to seep into her mind. All unwittingly
Martin Howe was made a party in a diabolical
scheme to defraud her&mdash;the woman who loved
him&mdash;of her birthright, of the home that should
have been hers.</p>
<p>The only way he could restore to her what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
was her own was to marry her, and to do that
he must perform the one deed he had pledged
himself never to be tempted into: he must rebuild
the wall. Otherwise the property would
pass into other hands.</p>
<p>Nothing could so injure the Howe estate as
to have a poor farm next door. Ellen of
course knew that. Ah, it was a vicious document&mdash;that
last Will and Testament of Ellen
Webster.</p>
<p>Mr. Benton&#8217;s voice broke in upon Lucy&#8217;s
musings.</p>
<p>&#8220;The deceased,&#8221; he added with a final grin
of appreciation, &#8220;appoints Mr. Elias Barnes
as executor, <i>he being</i>,&#8221; the lawyer quoted from
the written page, &#8220;<i>the meanest man I know</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus did the voice of the dead speak from
the confines of the grave! Death had neither
transformed nor weakened the intrepid hater.
From her aunt&#8217;s coffin Lucy could seem to
hear vindictive chuckles of revenge and hatred,
and a mist gathered before her eyes.</p>
<p>She had had no regrets for the loss of Ellen&#8217;s
body; but she could not but lament with genuine
grief the loss of her soul.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>LUCY COMES TO A DECISION</h3>
</div>

<p>Slowly Lucy drove homeward, her dreams
of rosy wall papers and gay chintz hangings
shattered. Thrusting into insignificance these
minor considerations, however, was the thought
of Martin Howe and what he would say to the
revelation of Ellen&#8217;s cupidity.</p>
<p>She would not tell him about the will, on
that she was determined. She would not mention
it to anybody. Instead she would go
promptly to work packing up her few possessions
and putting the house in perfect order.
Fortunately it had so recently been cleaned
that to prepare it for closing would be a simple
matter.</p>
<p>As for herself and Martin, the dupes of an
old woman&#8217;s vengeance, both of them were of
course blameless. Nevertheless, the present
twist of Fate had entirely changed their relation
to one another.</p>
<p>When she had defied her aunt and voiced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
with such pride her love for the man of her
heart, it had been in a joyous faith that although
he had not made similar confession, he
would ultimately do so. The possibility that
he was making of her affection a tool for vengeance
had never come into her mind until Ellen
had put it there, and then with involuntary
loyalty she had instantly dismissed the suggestion
as absurd. But here was a different
situation. She was no longer independent of
circumstances. She was penniless in the
world, all the things that should have been hers
having been swept away by the malicious stroke
of a pen. It was almost as tragic to be married
out of spite as out of pity.</p>
<p>She knew Martin&#8217;s standards of honor. He
would recognize, as she did, the justice of the
Webster homestead and lands remaining in her
possession; and since the will stipulated that
he must personally occupy these properties and
could neither sell, transfer, nor give them to
their rightful owner, she felt sure he would
seize upon the only other means of making her
freehold legally hers. Whether he loved her
or not would not now be in his eyes the paramount
issue. In wedding her he would feel
he was carrying out an act of justice which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
under the guise of affection it would be quite
legitimate to perform.</p>
<p>This solution of the difficulty, however,
cleared away but the minor half of the dilemma.
Had she been willing to accept Martin&#8217;s sacrifice
of himself and marry him, there still remained
the wall,&mdash;the obstacle that for generations
had loomed between the peace of Howe
and Webster and now loomed &#8217;twixt her and
her lover with a magnitude it had never assumed
before.</p>
<p>Martin would never rebuild that wall&mdash;never!</p>
<p>Had he not vowed that he would be burned
at the stake first? That he would face persecution,
nakedness, famine, the sword before he
would do it? All the iron of generations of
Howe blood rung in the oath. He had proclaimed
the decree throughout the county.
Everybody for miles around knew how he felt.
Though he loved her as man had never loved
woman (a miracle which she had no ground for
supposing) he would never consent to such a
compromise of principles. The being did not
exist for whom Martin Howe would abandon
his creed of honor.</p>
<p>She knew well that strata of hardness in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
nature, the adamantine will that wrought torture
to its possessor because it could not bend.
Even the concessions he had thus far made,
had, she recognized, cost him a vital struggle.
On the day of her aunt&#8217;s seizure had she not
witnessed the warfare between pity and hatred,
generosity and revenge? The powers of light
had triumphed, it is true; but it had been only
after the bitterest travail; and ever since she
had been conscious that within his soul Martin
had viewed his victory with a smoldering, unformulated
contempt. Even his attentions to
her had been paid with a blindfolded, lethargic
unwillingness, as if he offered them against the
dictates of his conscience and closed his eyes
to a crisis he would not, dared not face.</p>
<p>It was one thing for her to light-heartedly
announce that she loved Martin Howe and
would marry him; but it was quite another
matter for him to reach a corresponding conclusion.
To her vengeance was an antiquated
creed, a remnant of a past decade, which it
cost her no effort to brush aside. Martin, on
the contrary, was built of sterner stuff. He
hated with the vigor of the red-blooded hater,
fostering with sincerity the old-fashioned
dogmas of justice and retribution. &#8220;An eye
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
for an eye, a tooth for a tooth&#8221; was a matter
of right; and the mercy that would temper it
was not always a virtue. More often it was
a weakness.</p>
<p>To be caught in Ellen Webster&#8217;s toils and
own himself beaten would, Lucy well understood,
be to his mind a humiliating fate.</p>
<p>Only a compelling, unreasoning love that
swept over him like some mighty tidal wave,
wrenching from its foundations every impeding
barrier, could move him to surrender; and
who was she to arouse such passion in any
lover? She was only a woman human and
faulty. She had indeed a heart to bestow, and
without vain boasting it was a heart worth the
winning; she held herself in sufficient esteem to
set a price on the treasure. But was it jewel
enough to prompt a man to uproot every tradition
of his moral world for its possession?</p>
<p>Sadly she shook her head. No, Martin
would never be lost in a mood of such over-mastering
love as this for her. If he made a
proposal of marriage, it would be because he
was spurred by impulses of justice and pity;
and no matter how worthy these motives, he
would degenerate into the laughing stock of
the community the instant he began to carry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
out the terms of the will and reconstruct the
wall. She could hear now the taunts and jests
of the townsfolk. Some of them would speak
in good-humored banter, some with premeditated
malice; but their jibes would sting.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>So you&#8217;re tacklin&#8217; that wall in spite of all
you said, are you, Martin?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ellen Webster&#8217;s got you where she wanted
you at last, ain&#8217;t she, Martin?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>This would be a proud day for the Websters,
Martin!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>There would even be those who would meanly
assert that a man could be made to do anything
for money.</p>
<p>Ah, she knew what the villagers would say,
and so, too, would Martin. How his proud
spirit would writhe and smart under the lash
of their tongues! Neither pity nor love for
her should ever place him in a position of such
humiliation.</p>
<p>Before he was confronted by the choice of
turning her out of doors, or marrying her and
making himself the butt of the county wits, she
must clear his path from embarrassment and
be gone. She had a pittance of her own that
would support her until she could find employment
that would render her independent of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
charity. Her future would unquestionably be
lonely, since she must leave behind her not only
the man she loved but the home about which
her fondest dreams centered. Nevertheless,
she had never lacked courage to do what must
be done; and in the present emergency the
pride of the Websters came surging to re-enforce
her in her purpose.</p>
<p>Nobody must know she was going away&mdash;nobody.
There must be no leave-takings and
no tears. The regrets she had at parting with
all she held dear she would keep to herself, nor
should any of her kindly acquaintances have
the opportunity to offer to her a sheltering roof
as they had to old Libby Davis, the town
pauper.</p>
<p>Laughing hysterically, she dashed aside the
tears that gathered in her eyes. Would it not
be ironic if the Webster mansion became a
poor farm and she its first inmate?</p>
<p>As for Martin&mdash;a quick sob choked her.
Well, he should be left free to follow whatever
course he ordained. Perhaps he would scornfully
turn Ellen&#8217;s bequest back to the town;
perhaps, on the other hand, he would conquer
his scruples, rebuild the wall, and become rich
and prosperous as a result. With an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
augmented bank account and plenty of fertile
land, what might he not accomplish? Why, it
would make him one of the largest land-owners
in the State!</p>
<p>A glow of pleasure thrilled her. She hoped
he would accept the legacy; she prayed he
would.</p>
<p>Then, even though she were lonely and
penniless, she would have the satisfaction of
knowing that what she had forfeited had been
for his betterment. There would be some joy
in that. To give over her ancestral homestead
for a pauper institution that was neither
needed nor necessary, and was only a spiteful
device of Ellen&#8217;s to outwit her was an empty
charity.</p>
<p>Having thus formulated her future action,
Lucy hastened to carry out her plans with all
speed. Before Mr. Benton imparted to Martin
the terms of the will, before any hint of
them reached his ears, she must be far from
Sefton Falls; otherwise he might anticipate
her determination and thwart her in it.</p>
<p>How fortunate it was that there was so little
to impede her flight! All she owned in the
world she could quickly pack into the small
trunk she had brought with her from the West.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
Not to one article in the house had she any
claim; Mr. Benton had impressed that upon
her mind. Even the family silver, the little
dented mug from which her father had drunk
his milk had been willed away.</p>
<p>However, what did it matter now? Sentiment
was a foolish thing. There would never
be any more Websters to inherit these heirlooms.
She was the last of the line; and she
would never marry.</p>
<p>Having reached this climax in her meditations,
she turned into the driveway and, halting
before the barn door, called to Tony to come
and take the horse. Afterward she disappeared
into the house.</p>
<p>All the afternoon she worked feverishly,
putting everything into irreproachable order.
Then she packed her few belongings into the
little brown trunk. It was four o&#8217;clock when
she summoned the Portuguese boy from the
field.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to take me and my trunk to the
station, Tony,&#8221; she said, struggling to make
the order a casual one. &#8220;Then you are to
come back here and go on with your work as
usual until Mr. Howe or some one else asks you
to do otherwise. I will pay you a month in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
advance, and by that time you will be told
what you are to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tony eyed her uncomprehendingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t leavin&#8217; for good, Miss Lucy?&#8221;
he inquired at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;B&mdash;u&mdash;t&mdash;t&mdash;how can you? Ain&#8217;t this
your home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now, Tony.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bewildered foreigner scratched his
head.</p>
<p>The girl had been kind to him, and he was
devoted to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began.</p>
<p>&#8220;By and by you will understand,&#8221; said Lucy
gently. &#8220;It is all right. I want to go away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To go away from here?&#8221; gasped the lad.</p>
<p>Lucy nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it that you&#8217;re lonely since Miss Ellen
died?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tony was thoughtful; then with sudden inspiration
he ventured the remark:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe you&#8217;re afraid to stay alone by yourself
in the house nights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t seen a ghost?&#8221; he whispered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going away because of a ghost, yes,&#8221;
Lucy murmured half to herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I don&#8217;t blame you,&#8221; exclaimed Tony
vehemently. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t ketch me stayin&#8217;
in a house that was haunted by spirits. Where
you goin&#8217;&mdash;back out West?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps so.&#8221;</p>
<p>She helped him to carry the trunk out to the
wagon and strap it in; then she got in herself.</p>
<p>As they drove in silence out of the yard, not
a soul was in sight; nor was there any delay
at the station to give rise to gossip. She had
calculated with such nicety that the engine was
puffing round the bend in the track when she
alighted on the platform.</p>
<p>Hurriedly she bought her ticket, checked her
trunk, and put her foot on the step as the train
started.</p>
<p>Waving a good-by to the faithful servant,
who still lingered, she passed into the car and
sank down into a seat. She watched the valley,
beautiful in amethyst lights, flit past the
window; then Sefton Falls, flanked by misty
hills, came into sight and disappeared. At last
all the familiar country of the moving panorama
was blotted out by the darkness, and she
was alone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>Her eyes dropped to the ticket in her lap.
Why she had chosen that destination she could
not have told. It would, however, serve as
well as another. If in future she was to be
forever cut off from all she loved on earth, what
did it matter where she went?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE GREAT ALTERNATIVE</h3>
</div>

<p>After Lucy left the office, Mr. Benton sat
for an interval thinking. Then he yawned,
stretched his arms, went to his desk drawer, and
took out the will which he slipped into his
waistcoat pocket.</p>
<p>With hands behind him he took a turn or two
across the room.</p>
<p>He was a man not lacking in feeling, and
impulses of sympathy and mercy until now
had deterred him from the execution of his
legal duties. Since, however, it was Lucy
Webster who had rung up the curtain on the
drama in which an important part had been assigned
him, there was no need for him to postpone
longer the playing of his rôle. He had
received his cue.</p>
<p>His lines, he admitted, were not wholly to
his liking&mdash;not, in fact, to his liking at all; he
considered them cruel, unfair, vindictive.
Notwithstanding this, however, the plot was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
a novel one, and he was too human not to relish
the fascinating uncertainties it presented. In
all his professional career no case so remarkable
had fallen to his lot before.</p>
<p>When as a young man he had attacked his
calling, he had been thrilled with enthusiasm
and hope. The law had seemed to him the
noblest of professions. But the limitations of
a small town had quickly dampened his ardor,
and instead of righting the injustices of the
world as he had once dreamed of doing, he had
narrowed into a legal machine whose mechanism
was never accelerated by anything more
stirring than a round of petty will-makings,
land-sellings, bill collections and mortgage
foreclosures.</p>
<p>But at last here was something out of the
ordinary, a refreshing and unique human comedy
that would not only electrify the public but
whose chief actors balked all speculation. He
could not help owning that Ellen Webster&#8217;s
bequest, heartily as he disapproved of it, lent
a welcome bit of color to the grayness of his
days. Ever since he had drawn up the fantastic
document it had furnished him with
riddles so interesting and unsolvable that they
rendered tales of Peter Featherstone and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
Martin Chuzzlewit tame reading. These worthies
were only creations of paper and ink; but here
was a living, breathing enigma,&mdash;the enigma
of Martin Howe!</p>
<p>What would this hero of the present situation
do? For undoubtedly it was Martin who
was to be the chief actor of the coming drama.</p>
<p>The lawyer knocked the ashes from his pipe,
thrust it into his pocket and, putting on his hat
and coat, stepped into the hall, where he
lingered only long enough to post on his office
door the hastily scrawled announcement: &#8220;Will
return to-morrow.&#8221; Then he hurried across
the town green to the shed behind the church
where he always hitched his horse. Backing
the wagon out with care, he jumped into
it and proceeded to drive off down the high
road.</p>
<p>Martin Howe was in the field when Mr.
Benton arrived. Under ordinary conditions
the man would have joined him there, but to-day
such a course seemed too informal, and instead
he drew up his horse at the front door
and sent Jane to summon her brother.</p>
<p>Fortunately Martin was no great distance
away and soon entered, a flicker of curiosity in
his eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></p>
<p>The lawyer began with a leisurely introduction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagine, Howe, you are a trifle surprised
to have a call from me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I drove over on business,&#8221; announced Mr.
Benton.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, although he prefaced his revelation
with this remark, he did not immediately
enlighten his listener as to what the business
was. In truth, now that the great moment for
breaking silence had arrived, Mr. Benton
found himself obsessed with a desire to prolong
its flavor of mystery. It was like rolling the
honied tang of a cordial beneath his tongue.
A few words and the secret would lay bare in
the light of common day, its glamor rent to
atoms.</p>
<p>Martin waited patiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;On business,&#8221; repeated Mr. Benton at last,
as if there had been no break in the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to hear it,&#8221; Martin said, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came, in fact, to acquaint you with the
contents of a will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet again the lawyer&#8217;s tongue, sphinxlike
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
from habit, refused to utter the tidings it
guarded.</p>
<p>&#8220;The will,&#8221; he presently resumed, &#8220;of my
client, Miss Ellen Webster.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was rewarded by seeing a shock of surprise
run through Martin&#8217;s frame.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how Miss Webster&#8217;s will can be
any concern of mine,&#8221; Martin replied stiffly.</p>
<p>The attorney ignored the observation. Continuing
with serenity, he observed:</p>
<p>&#8220;As I understand it, you and Miss Webster
were not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he coughed hesitatingly behind
his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we weren&#8217;t,&#8221; cut in Martin. &#8220;She
was a meddling, aggravating old harridan. I
hated her, and I&#8217;m glad she&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is an unfortunate sentiment,&#8221; remarked
Mr. Benton, &#8220;unfortunate and disconcerting,
because, you see, Miss Ellen Webster
has left you all her property.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Me</i>! Left <i>me</i> her property!&#8221;</p>
<p>The dynamic shock behind the words sent
the man to his feet.</p>
<p>Mr. Benton nodded calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he reiterated, &#8220;Miss Webster has
made you her sole legatee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin regarded his visitor stupidly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon there&#8217;s some mistake, sir,&#8221; he
contrived to stammer.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, there isn&#8217;t&mdash;there&#8217;s no mistake. The
will was legally drawn up only a few days before
the death of the deceased. No possible
question can be raised as to her sanity, or the
clearness of her wishes concerning her property.
She desired everything to come to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see the paper!&#8221; cried Martin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should prefer to read it to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly Mr. Benton took out his spectacles,
polished, and adjusted them. Then with impressive
deliberation he drew forth and unfolded
with a mighty rustling the last will and
testament of Ellen Webster, spinster. Many
a time he had mentally rehearsed this scene,
and now he presented it with a dignity that
amazed and awed. Every <i>whereas</i> and <i>aforesaid</i>
rolled out with due majesty, its resonance
echoing to the ceiling of the chilly little parlor.</p>
<p>As Martin listened, curiosity gave place to
wonder, wonder to indignation. But when at
last the concluding condition of the bequest
was reached, the rebuilding of the wall, an oath
burst from his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;The harpy!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;The insolent
hell hag!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Softly, my dear sir, softly!&#8221; pleaded Mr.
Benton in soothing tones.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have nothin&#8217; to do with it&mdash;nothin&#8217;!&#8221;
stormed Martin. &#8220;You can bundle your
paper right out of here, Benton. Rebuild that
wall! Good God! Why, I wouldn&#8217;t do it if
I was to be flayed alive. Ellen Webster knew
that well enough. She was perfectly safe
when she left me her property with that tag
hitched to it. She did it as a joke&mdash;a cussed
joke&mdash;out of pure deviltry. &#8217;Twas like her,
too. She couldn&#8217;t resist giving me one last
jab, even if she had to wait till she was dead
and gone to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like an infuriated beast Martin tramped
the floor. Mr. Benton did not speak for a few
moments; then he observed mildly:</p>
<p>&#8220;You understand that if you refuse to accept
the property it will be turned over to the
county for a poor farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care who it&#8217;s turned over to, or
what becomes of it,&#8221; blustered Martin.</p>
<p>The attorney rubbed his hands. Ah, it was
a spirited drama,&mdash;quite as spirited as he had
anticipated, and as interesting too.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty rough on the girl,&#8221; he at last
remarked casually.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Webster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Violently Martin came to himself. The
fury of his anger had until now swept every
other consideration from his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will mean turning Miss Webster out of
doors, of course,&#8221; continued Mr. Benton impassively.
&#8220;Still she&#8217;s a thoroughbred, and I
fancy nothing her aunt could do would surprise
her. In fact, she as good as told me that,
when she was at my office this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She knows, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I had to tell her, poor thing. I imagine,
too, it hit her pretty hard, for she had
been given to understand that everything was
to be hers. She hasn&#8217;t much in her own right;
her aunt told me that.&#8221;</p>
<p>An icy hand suddenly gripped Martin&#8217;s
heart. He stood immovable, as if stunned.
Lucy! Lucy penniless and homeless because
of him!</p>
<p>Little by little Ellen&#8217;s evil scheme unfolded
itself before his consciousness. He saw the
cunning of the intrigue which the initial outburst
of his wrath had obscured. There was
more involved in his decision than his own inclinations.
He was not free simply to flout
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
the legacy and toss it angrily aside. Ellen, a
Richelieu to the last, had him in a trap that
wrenched and wrecked every sensibility of his
nature. The more he thought about the matter,
the more chaotic his impulses became.
Justice battled against will; pity against vengeance;
love against hate; and as the warring
factors strove and tore at one another, and
grappled in an anguish of suffering, from out
the turmoil two forces rose unconquerable and
stubbornly confronted one another,&mdash;the opposing
forces of Love and Pride. There they
stood, neither of them willing to yield. While
Love pleaded for mercy, Pride urged the destruction
of every gentler emotion and clamored
for revenge.</p>
<p>Mr. Benton was not a subtle interpreter of
human nature, but in the face of the man before
him he saw enough to realize the fierceness
of the spiritual conflict that raged within Martin
Howe&#8217;s soul. It was like witnessing the
writhings of a creature in torture.</p>
<p>He did not attempt to precipitate a decision
by interfering. When, however, he had been
a silent spectator of the struggle so long that
he perceived Martin had forgotten his very
existence, he ventured to speak.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;d better leave you to reconsider
your resolution, Howe,&#8221; he remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;yes&mdash;it might be better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps after you&#8217;ve thought things out,
you&#8217;ll change your mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin did not reply. The lawyer rose and
took up his hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long before you&#8217;ve got to know?&#8221;
inquired Martin hoarsely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can give you time,&#8221; answered Mr.
Benton easily. &#8220;A week, say&mdash;how will that
do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t need as long as that,&#8221; Martin replied,
looking before him with set face. &#8220;I
shall know by to-morrow what I am going
to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no such hurry as all that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall know by to-morrow,&#8221; repeated
the younger man in the same dull voice. &#8220;All
the time in the universe won&#8217;t change things
after that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Benton made no response. When in
his imaginings he had pictured the scene, he
had thought that after the first shock of surprise
was over, he and Martin would sit down
together sociably and discuss each petty detail
of the remarkable comedy. But comedy had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
suddenly become tragedy&mdash;a tragedy very real
and grim&mdash;and all desire to discuss it had
ebbed away.</p>
<p>As he moved toward the door, he did not
even put out his hand; on the contrary, whispering
a hushed good night and receiving
no reply to it, he softly let himself out
and disappeared through the afternoon shadows.</p>
<p>If Martin were conscious of his departure,
he at least gave no sign of being so, but continued
to stand motionless in the same spot
where Mr. Benton had left him, his hands
gripped tightly behind his back, and his head
thrust forward in thought.</p>
<p>Silently the hours passed. The sun sank
behind the hills, tinting the ridge of pines to
copper and leaving the sky a sweep of palest
blue in which a single star trembled.</p>
<p>Still Martin did not move. Once he broke
into a smothered cry:</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot! My God! I cannot!&#8221;</p>
<p>The words brought Jane to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin!&#8221; she called.</p>
<p>There was no answer and, turning the knob
timidly, she came in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she ejaculated. &#8220;How you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
frightened me! I didn&#8217;t know there was anybody
here. Don&#8217;t you want a light?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has&mdash;has Mr. Benton gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. Supper&#8217;s ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy, Martin! You ain&#8217;t sick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you must be hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still the woman lingered; then making a
heroic plunge, she faltered:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&mdash;there ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; the matter, is
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>So genuine was the sympathy beneath the
quavering inquiry that it brought to Martin&#8217;s
troubled heart a gratifying sense of warmth
and fellowship.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, his impatience melting to
gentleness. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Jane. I&#8217;ve just
got to do a little thinking by myself, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t money you&#8217;re fussin&#8217; over then,&#8221;
said his sister, with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no, indeed. It&#8217;s nothin&#8217; to do with
money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thankful for that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>Nevertheless as he mounted to his room,
Martin reflected that after all it was money
which was at the storm center of his difficulties.
He had not thought at all of the matter from
its financial aspect. Yet even if he had done
so in the first place, it would have had no influence
upon his decision. He didn&#8217;t care a curse
for the money. To carry his point, he would
have tossed aside a fortune twice as large. The
issue he confronted, stripped of all its distractions,
was simply whether his love were potent
enough to overmaster his pride and bring it to
its knees.</p>
<p>Even for the sake of Lucy Webster, whom
he now realized he loved with a passion more
deep-rooted than he had dreamed, could he
compel himself to do the thing he had staked
his oath he would not do?</p>
<p>Until this moment he had never actually examined
his affection for the girl. Events had
shaped themselves so naturally that in cowardly
fashion he had basked in the joy of the
present and not troubled his mind to inquire
whither the phantasies of this lotus-eater&#8217;s existence
were leading him. When a clamoring
conscience had lifted up its voice, he had stilled
it with platitudes. The impact of the crisis he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
now faced had, however, jarred him out of his
tranquillity and brought him to an appreciation
of his position.</p>
<p>He loved Lucy Webster with sincere devotion.
All he had in the world he would gladly
cast at her feet,&mdash;his name, his heart, his
worldly possessions; only one reservation did
he make to the completeness of his surrender.
His pride he could not bend. It was not that
he did not wish to bend it. The act was impossible.
Keenly as he scorned himself, he
could not concede a victory to Ellen Webster,&mdash;not
for any one on earth.</p>
<p>The jests of the townsfolk were nothing.
He did not lack courage to laugh back into the
faces of the jeering multitude. But to own
himself beaten by a mocking ghost, a specter
from another sphere; to relinquish for her
gratification the traditions of his race and the
trust of his fathers; to leave her triumphant on
the field,&mdash;this he could not do for any woman
living&mdash;or dead.</p>
<p>Ah, it was a clever net the old woman had
spun to ensnare him, more clever than she
knew, unless by some occult power she was
cognizant of his affection for Lucy. Could it
be? The thought arrested him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>Had Ellen guessed his secret, and, armed
with the knowledge, shaped her revenge accordingly?
If so, she was a thousand times
more cruel than he had imagined her capable of
being, and it gave quite a different slant to her
perfidy. Suppose she had suspected he loved
Lucy and that Lucy loved him. Then her
plot was one to separate them, and the very
course he was following was the result she had
striven to bring about. She had meant to
wreck his happiness and that of the woman he
loved; she had planned, schemed, worked to
do so.</p>
<p>Martin threw back his head and laughed defiantly
up at the ceiling. Well, she should not
succeed. He would marry Lucy, and he
would rebuild the wall: and with every stone
he put in place he would shout to the confines
of the universe, to the planets where Ellen
Webster&#8217;s spirit lurked, to the grave that harbored
her bones:</p>
<p><i>Amor Vincit Omnia!</i></p>
<p>With jubilant step he crossed to the window
and looked out. A slender arc of silver hung
above the trees, bathing the fields in mystic
splendor. It was not late. Only the maelstrom
of torture through which he had passed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
had transformed the minutes to hours, and the
hours to years. Why, the evening was still
young, young enough for him to go to Lucy
and speak into her ear all the love that surged
in his heart. They had been made for one another
from the beginning. He would wed her,
and the old homestead she venerated should be
hers indeed. It was all very simple, now.</p>
<p>With the abandon of a schoolboy he rushed
downstairs, pausing only an instant to put his
head in at the kitchen door and shout to
Jane:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; over to the Websters&#8217;. I may be
late. Don&#8217;t sit up for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he was gone. Alone beneath the arching
sky, his happiness mounted to the stars.
How delicious was the freshness of the cool
night air! How sweet the damp fragrance of
the forest! The spires of the pines richly dark
against the fading sky were already receding
into the mists of twilight.</p>
<p>He went along down the road, his swinging
step light as the shimmer of a moonbeam across
a spangled pool.</p>
<p>The Webster house was in darkness. Nevertheless
this discovery did not disconcert him,
for frequently Lucy worked until dusk among
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
her flowers, or lingered on the porch in the
peace of the evening stillness.</p>
<p>To-night, however, he failed to find her in
either of her favorite haunts and, guided by the
wailing music of a harmonica, he came at last
upon Tony seated on an upturned barrel at the
barn threshold, striving to banish his loneliness
by breathing into the serenity of the twilight
the refrain of &#8220;Home, Sweet Home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, Tony!&#8221; called Martin. &#8220;Do you
know where Miss Lucy is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t, sir,&#8221; replied the boy, rising. &#8220;She
didn&#8217;t &#8217;xactly say where she was goin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose she&#8217;s round the place somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Land, no, sir! Didn&#8217;t she tell you? Why,
she went away on the train this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the train?&#8221; Martin repeated automatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When is she comin&#8217; back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217;t comin&#8217; back,&#8221; announced the
Portuguese. &#8220;She&#8217;s goin&#8217; out West or somewheres
to live.&#8221;</p>
<p>A quick shiver vibrated through Martin&#8217;s
body, arresting the beat of his pulse. Scarcely
knowing what he did, he caught the lad roughly
by the shoulder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When did she go?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;What
time? What did she say?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tony raised a frightened glance to his questioner&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;She went this afternoon,&#8221; gasped he,
&#8220;about five o&#8217;clock it was. She took the Boston
train. She said she guessed she&#8217;d go back
out West &#8217;cause she didn&#8217;t want to stay here
any more. She was afraid of ghosts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ghosts!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tony nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m to leave the key of the house at Mr.
Benton&#8217;s in the mornin&#8217; an&#8217; tell him everythin&#8217;s
cleaned up an&#8217; in order. An&#8217; Miss Lucy said
I was to stay here an&#8217; go on with the work till
you or somebody else told me to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without comment Martin listened. Slowly
the truth made its impress on his mind. Lucy
had gone! Gone!</p>
<p>With the knowledge, all the latent affection
he felt for her crystallized into a mighty tide
that rushed over and engulfed him in its current.
Hatred, revenge, pride were no more;
only love persisted,&mdash;love the all-powerful, the
all-conquering, the all-transforming.</p>
<p>Lucy, dearer to him than his own soul, had
gone. Either in anger, or driven forth by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
maiden shyness, she had fled from him; and
until she was brought back and was safe within
the shelter of his arms, nothing remained for
him in life.</p>
<p>Tony saw him square his shoulders and turn
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night, Mr. Howe,&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night, Tony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any orders for to-morrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Go on with your work as usual.
Just be sure to water Miss Lucy&#8217;s flowers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; by the way. You needn&#8217;t drive into
town with that key. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to Mr. Benton&#8217;s
myself, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy watched Martin go down the driveway;
but at the gate the man wheeled about
and shouted back:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be sure not to forget Miss Lucy&#8217;s
flowers, Tony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; if I should have to be away for a
while&mdash;a week, or a month, or even longer&mdash;you&#8217;ll
do the best you can while I&#8217;m gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all. Good night.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></p>
<p>With a farewell gesture of his hand Martin
passed out of the gate. To have witnessed the
buoyancy of his stride, one would have thought
him victorious rather than defeated. The
truth was, the scent of battle was in his nostrils.
For a lifetime he had been the champion of
Hate. Now, all the energies of his manhood
suddenly awakened, he was going forth to fight
in the cause of Love.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>LOVE TRIUMPHANT</h3>
</div>

<p>Serene in spirit, Martin turned into the
road, his future plain before him. He would
search Lucy out, marry her, and bring her back
to her own home. How blind he had been that
he should not have seen his path from the beginning!
Why, it was the only thing to do, the
only possible thing!</p>
<p>There might be, there undoubtedly would be
difficulties in tracing his sweetheart&#8217;s whereabouts,
but he did not anticipate encountering
any insurmountable obstacle to the undertaking:
and should he be balked by circumstance
it was always possible to seek assistance from
those whose business it was to untangle just
such puzzles. Therefore, with head held high,
he hastened toward home, formulating his
plans as he went along.</p>
<p>With the dawning of to-morrow&#8217;s sun he
must set forth for the western town which, if
Tony&#8217;s testimony was to be trusted, was Lucy&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
ultimate destination. It was a pity his fugitive
lady had twelve hours&#8217; start of him. However,
he must overtake her as best he might.</p>
<p>It was unquestionably unfortunate too, that
it was such a bad season of the year for him to
be absent from home. Harvest time was fast
approaching, and he could ill be spared. But
of what consequence were crops and the garnering
of them when weighed against an issue of
such life import as this? To plant and gather
was a matter of a year, while all eternity was
bound up in his and Lucy&#8217;s future together.</p>
<p>In consequence, although he realized the
probable financial loss that would result from
his going on this amorous pilgrimage, the
measure of his love was so great that everything
else, even the patient toil of months, was
as nothing beside it.</p>
<p>It came to him that perhaps, if he confided
his present dilemma to his sisters, they might
come to his rescue, and in the exigency of sudden
frosts save at least a portion of his crops
from loss. They were fond of Lucy. Sometimes
he had even thought they guessed his
secret and were desirous of helping on the romance.
At least, he felt sure they would not
oppose it, for they had always been eager that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
he should marry and leave an heir to inherit the
Howe acreage; they had even gone so far as to
urge it upon him as his patriotic duty. Moreover,
they were very desirous of demolishing the
barrier that for so many years had estranged
Howe and Webster.</p>
<p>The more he reflected on taking them into
his confidence, the more desirable became the
idea, and at length he decided that before he
went to bed he would have a frank talk with the
three women of his household and lay before
them all his troubles. If he were to do this he
must hasten, for Sefton Falls kept early
hours.</p>
<p>When, however, he reached his own land, he
found the lights in the house still burning, and
he was surprised to see Jane, a shawl thrown
over her head, coming to meet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin!&#8221; she called, &#8220;is that you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The words contained a disquieting echo of
anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;ve got back!&#8221; she
exclaimed. &#8220;I was just goin&#8217; over to the
Websters&#8217; to find you. A telephone message
has just come while you&#8217;ve been gone.
Lucy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; interrupted Martin breathlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been an accident to the Boston
train, an&#8217; they telephoned from the hospital at
Ashbury that she&#8217;d been hurt. They wanted I
should come down there!&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw Martin reel and put out his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin!&#8221; she cried, rushing to his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she much hurt? When did the message
come?&#8221; panted the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just now,&#8221; Jane answered. &#8220;The doctor
said her arm was broken an&#8217; that she was pretty
well shaken up an&#8217; bruised. He didn&#8217;t send
for me so much because she was in a serious
condition as because her bag with all her money
an&#8217; papers was lost, an&#8217; she was worryin&#8217; herself
sick over being without a cent, poor child.
He didn&#8217;t tell her he&#8217;d sent for me. He just
did it on his own responsibility. Oh, Martin,
you will let me go an&#8217; bring her back here,
won&#8217;t you? Mary an&#8217; &#8217;Liza an&#8217; I want to
nurse her, ourselves. We can&#8217;t bear to think
of her bein&#8217; a charity patient in a hospital.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane&#8217;s voice trembled with earnestness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you shall go, Jane,&#8221; Martin answered
quickly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll both go. I&#8217;ll see right
away if we can get Watford to take us in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
touring car. We ought to make the distance
in four hours in a high-power machine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy, you&#8217;re not goin&#8217; to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s no need of that,&#8221; protested
Jane. &#8220;The doctor said Lucy was gettin&#8217; on
finely, an&#8217; he hoped she&#8217;d quiet down an&#8217; get
some sleep, which was what she needed most.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;d rather go now&mdash;right away,&#8221; Martin
asserted.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twould do no good,&#8221; explained the practical
Jane. &#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t get to Ashbury until
the middle of the night, an&#8217; we couldn&#8217;t see
Lucy. You wouldn&#8217;t want &#8217;em to wake her
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N&mdash;o.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be much wiser to wait till mornin&#8217;,
Martin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it will.&#8221;</p>
<p>The brother and sister walked silently across
the turf.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&mdash;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re willin&#8217; we should
take care of Lucy,&#8221; murmured Jane, after an
awkward pause. &#8220;Mary, &#8217;Liza, an&#8217; I love her
dearly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I too, Jane.&#8221;</p>
<p>The confession came in a whisper. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
Martin expected it to be greeted with surprise, he
was disappointed.</p>
<p>Jane did not at first reply; then she said in a
soft, happy tone:</p>
<p>&#8220;I guessed as much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man laughed in shamefaced fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t a bat, Martin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again her brother laughed, this time with
less embarrassment. It had suddenly become
very easy to talk with Jane.</p>
<p>Welcoming her companionship and sympathy,
he found himself pouring into her listening
ear all his difficulties. He told her of
Ellen&#8217;s will; of the wall; of Lucy&#8217;s flight; of
his love for the girl. How good it was to
speak and share his troubles with another!</p>
<p>&#8220;How like Lucy to go away!&#8221; mused Jane,
when the recital was done. &#8220;Any self-respectin&#8217;
woman would have done the same, too.
She warn&#8217;t goin&#8217; to hang round here an&#8217; make
you marry her out of pity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I love her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but how was she to know that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She must have known it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never had told her so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N&mdash;o, not in so many words.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then what right, pray, had she to think
so?&#8221; argued Jane with warmth. &#8220;She warn&#8217;t
the sort of girl to chance it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I&#8217;d told her before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you had,&#8221; was Jane&#8217;s brief retort.
&#8220;You may have trouble now makin&#8217; her see
you ain&#8217;t marryin&#8217; her &#8217;cause you&#8217;re sorry for
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry for her!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane could not but laugh at the fervor of the
exclamation.</p>
<p>&#8220;My land! Martin,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I never
expected to live to see you so head over ears in
love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t questionin&#8217; it,&#8221; was Jane&#8217;s dry comment.</p>
<p>When, however, he set foot on the porch, his
lover&#8217;s confidence suddenly deserted him, and
he was overwhelmed with shyness.</p>
<p>&#8220;You tell Mary an&#8217; &#8217;Liza,&#8221; he pleaded.
&#8220;Somehow, I can&#8217;t. Tell &#8217;em about the will
an&#8217; all. You&#8217;ll do that much for me, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words spoke volumes.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. An&#8217; be ready to start for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
Ashbury on the mornin&#8217; train. We&#8217;d better
leave here by six, sharp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be on hand. Don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night, Jane.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still Jane lingered. Then drawing very
close to her brother&#8217;s side, she added bashfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t but think, Martin, that instead of
puttin&#8217; up walls, Ellen Webster&#8217;s will has
broken some of &#8217;em down.&#8221;</p>
<p>For answer Martin did something he had
never done before within the span of his memory;
he bent impulsively and kissed his sister&#8217;s
cheek.</p>
<p>Then as if embarrassed by the spontaneity
of the deed, he sped upstairs.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>In the morning he and Jane started for Ashbury.
The day was just waking as they drove
along the glittering highway. Heavy dew silvered
field and meadow, and the sun, flashing
bars of light across the valley, transformed
every growing thing into jeweled splendor.</p>
<p>Martin was in high spirits and so was Jane.
While the man counted the hours before he
would be once more at the side of his beloved,
the woman was thinking that whatever changes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
the future held in store, she would always have
it to remember that in this supreme moment of
his life it had been to her that Martin had
turned. She had been his confidant and
helper. It was worth all that had gone before
and all that might come after. There was no
need for conversation between them. The
reveries of each were satisfying and pregnant
with happiness.</p>
<p>Even after they had boarded the train, Jane
was quite content to lapse into meditation and
enjoy the novelty of the journey. Traveling
was not such a commonplace event that it had
ceased to be entertaining. She studied her fellow
passengers with keenest interest, watched
the pictures that framed themselves in the car
window, and delighted in a locomotion that
proceeded from no effort of her own. It was
not often that she was granted the luxury of
sitting still.</p>
<p>They reached Ashbury amid a clamor of
noontide whistles, and took a cab to the hospital.
Here the nurse met them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Webster has had her arm set and is
resting comfortably,&#8221; announced the woman.
&#8220;There is not the slightest cause for alarm.
We telephoned merely because she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
fretting and becoming feverish, and the doctor
feared she would not sleep. The loss of her
purse and bank books worried her. We found
your address in her coat pocket. She was too
dazed and confused to tell who her friends
were.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she expectin&#8217; us?&#8221; inquired Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; the nurse answered. &#8220;The doctor
decided not to tell her, after all, that we had
telephoned. For some reason she seemed unwilling
for people to know where she was. To
be frank, we rather regretted calling you up,
when we discovered how she felt about it. But
the mischief was done then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It warn&#8217;t no mischief,&#8221; Jane put in with a
smile. &#8220;It was the best thing that could &#8217;a&#8217;
happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could I see her, do you think?&#8221; demanded
the visitor presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed. She is much better this
morning. Perhaps, however, one caller at a
time will be enough; she still has some fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane turned to Martin; but he shook his
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do whatever you want me to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather you went first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as you say. I won&#8217;t stay long
though.&#8221;</p>
<p>After watching the two women disappear
down the long, rubber-carpeted corridor, he
began to pace the small, spotlessly neat office
in which he had been asked to wait. It was a
prim, barren room, heavy with the fumes of
iodoform and ether. At intervals, the muffled
tread of a doctor or nurse passing through the
hall broke its stillness, but otherwise there was
not a sound within its walls.</p>
<p>Martin walked back and forth until his solitude
became intolerable. There were magazines
on the table but he could not read.
Would Jane never return? The moments
seemed hours.</p>
<p>In his suspense he fell to every sort of pessimistic
imagining. Suppose Lucy were worse?
Suppose she declined to see him? Suppose
she did not love him?</p>
<p>So sanguine had been his hopes, he had not
seriously considered the latter possibility. The
more he meditated on the thought of failing in
his suit, the more wretched became his condition
of mind. The torrent of words that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
had come to speak slowly deserted his tongue
until when Jane entered, a quarter of an hour
later, wreathed in smiles, he was dumb with
terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s ever so much better than I expected
to find her,&#8221; began his sister without preamble.
&#8220;An&#8217; she was so glad to see me, poor soul!
You can go up now with the nurse; only don&#8217;t
stay too long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you tell her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began the discomfited
Martin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t tell her anything,&#8221; Jane replied,
&#8220;except that I was going to take her home
with me in a day or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t she know I&#8217;m here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know, then, whether she&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything, Martin,&#8221; Jane
replied, nevertheless beaming on him with a
radiant smile. &#8220;An&#8217; if I did I certainly
shouldn&#8217;t tell you. You an&#8217; Lucy must settle
your affairs yourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this dubious encouragement and palpitating
with uneasiness, Martin was forced to
tiptoe out of the room in the wake of his white-robed
conductor. As he walked down the
long, quiet hall, he said to himself that every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
step was bringing him nearer to the crisis when
he must speak, and still no words came to his
lips. When, however, he turned from the dinginess
of the passageway into the sunny little
room where Lucy lay, he forgot everything but
Lucy herself.</p>
<p>She was resting against the pillows, her hair
unbound, and her cheeks flushed to crimson.
Never had she looked so beautiful. He
stopped on the threshold, awed by the wonder
of her maidenhood. Then he heard her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was only a single word, but the yearning
in it told him all he sought to know. In an
instant he was on his knees beside her, kissing
the brown hand that rested on the coverlid,
touching his lips to the glory of her hair.</p>
<p>Jane, waiting in the meantime alone in the
dull, whitewashed office, had ample opportunity
to study every nail in its floor, count the
slats in the slippery, varnished chairs, and
speculate as to the identity of the spectacled
dignitaries whose portraits adorned the
walls.</p>
<p>She planned her winter&#8217;s wardrobe, decided
what Mary, Eliza and herself should wear at
the wedding, and mentally arranged every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
detail of the coming domestic upheaval. Having
exhausted all these subjects, she began in
quite indecent fashion to select names for her
future nieces and nephews. The first boy
should be Webster Howe. What a grand old
name it would be! She prayed he would be
tall like Martin, and have Lucy&#8217;s eyes and hair.
Ah, what a delight she and Mary and Eliza
would have bringing up Martin&#8217;s son and baking
cookies for him!</p>
<p>It was just when she was mapping out the
educational career of this same Webster Howe
and was struggling to decide what college
should be honored by his presence that Martin
burst into the room. A guilty blush dyed
Jane&#8217;s virgin cheek.</p>
<p>Martin, however, took no notice of her abstraction.
In fact he could scarcely speak
coherently.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Jane,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I&#8217;m the
happiest man on earth. Lucy loves me. Isn&#8217;t
it wonderful, unbelievable? We are goin&#8217; to
be married right away, an&#8217; I&#8217;m to start buildin&#8217;
the wall, so&#8217;st it will be done before the cold
weather comes. We&#8217;re goin&#8217; to leave a little
gate in it for you an&#8217; Mary an&#8217; &#8217;Liza to come
through. An&#8217; we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to put up a stone in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
the cemetery to Lucy&#8217;s aunt with: <i>In grateful
remembrance of Ellen Webster</i> on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane sniffed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can think of a better inscription than
that,&#8221; she remarked with unwonted tartness,
lapsing into Scripture. &#8220;Carve on it:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity;
and the rod of his anger shall fail.</i>&#8221;</p>
